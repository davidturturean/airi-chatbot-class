# AIRI Chatbot Updates

Several critical issues have been fixed in this update:

## 1. Fixed Embedding Model Format Error

Fixed the model name format in the embedding model which was causing errors:
- Changed from `"embedding-001"` to `"models/embedding-001"` as required by the API
- Added a fallback SimpleVectorStore implementation that doesn't rely on embeddings

## 2. Fixed Excel File Processing

Added specific support for Excel files that was failing due to missing dependencies:
- Added explicit installation and verification of `openpyxl` package
- Enhanced error handling for Excel file loading
- Prioritized the main Risk Repository Excel file for processing

## 3. Added Keyword-Based Search Fallback

Added a new fallback system that uses keyword-based search when embeddings fail:
- Created `simple_vector_store.py` with a pure Python implementation
- Added `run_simple_rebuild.sh` script to build this alternative database
- Modified AIRI adapter to automatically try this fallback when the main vector store fails

## 4. Fixed Streaming Response Functionality

The `generate_stream` method in `gemini_model.py` has been corrected to properly handle streaming responses. This function had implementation issues that could cause streaming to fail or provide incomplete responses.

## 5. Enhanced Dependency Management

The dependency installation scripts now explicitly handle all required packages with appropriate versions:
- Fixed installation of `langchain-google-genai==0.0.7` which was missing and causing errors
- Added explicit installation of `openpyxl` for Excel support
- Added specific version installations for critical packages like `pydantic` and `langchain`
- Added multiple fallback installation methods to ensure dependencies are properly installed

## 6. Improved Error Handling

Error handling has been improved throughout the codebase:
- Better error handling for streaming responses
- Better feedback when dependencies can't be installed
- Fallback mechanisms when formatting or retrieval fails
- Clearer error messages and instructions for troubleshooting

## How to Use the New Features

1. **To use the keyword-based search fallback**:
   ```bash
   ./run_simple_rebuild.sh
   ```
   This will create a simple database that doesn't require embeddings.

2. **For the best results**:
   First try to fix the embedding model format error by rebuilding the regular database:
   ```bash
   ./rebuild_database.sh
   ```
   If that still fails, use the simple keyword search option above.

3. **Test with specific queries**: Try questions about employment, harmful language, or self-driving cars to verify that the database is being searched correctly
