      "response": "Understanding how AI affects safety requires considering the fundamental distinction between intentional and unintentional risks. [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755)\n\n**Unintentional Risks**\nUnintentional risks arise from the inherent limitations, design flaws, or unforeseen behaviors of AI systems, not from malicious intent. The repository documents that generative AI, for instance, can cause \"hallucinations,\" where the model produces untruthful or unreasonable content presented as fact, leading to biased and misleading information [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). These are explicitly considered \"unintentional\" in their intent [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). Similarly, the repository highlights \"unintended safety issues\" stemming from a \"lack of capability or robustness\" in AI systems, posing questions about whether AI is safe with respect to human life and property [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). These risks often manifest post-deployment due to complex interactions or emergent properties of the AI.\n\n**Intentional Risks**\nConversely, intentional risks stem from deliberate actions, often with malicious intent, to exploit or misuse AI systems for harm. While the repository broadly asks if AI use will \"create unintended or intended safety issues\" [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825), the \"intended\" aspect refers to risks that are a direct consequence of a purposeful act. This could include an attacker leveraging AI vulnerabilities for cyberattacks, the deliberate deployment of AI for harmful surveillance, or the design of AI systems with inherent capabilities for misuse. These risks are distinct because they involve a human or entity's conscious decision to cause harm or to design a system with harmful capabilities.\n\n**Key Differences and Mitigation**\nThe core difference lies in the origin of the harm: unintentional risks stem from system limitations or emergent properties, while intentional risks originate from deliberate human action. Mitigation strategies for unintentional risks often focus on robust testing, explainability, bias detection, and continuous monitoring to improve system reliability and robustness [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755), [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). For intentional risks, mitigation involves robust security measures, threat intelligence, ethical guidelines, and legal frameworks to deter and prevent malicious actors from exploiting AI.",

      "response": "When AI is deployed, AI-related safety issues typically involve risks stemming from the inherent properties, design, or autonomous behaviors of the AI system itself, distinct from risks directly caused by human error or intent. [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755)\n\nThe MIT AI Risk Repository documents AI-caused risks primarily as those arising from the AI's operational characteristics or limitations. For instance, the repository highlights concerns about whether AI systems are \"safe with respect to human life and property\" and if their use will \"create unintended or intended safety issues\" [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). A clear example of an AI-caused risk is \"hallucinations\" in generative AI, where \"an AI model generates untruthful or unreasonable content but presents it as if it were a fact, leading to biased and misleading information\" [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). This is categorized as an \"unintentional\" risk from \"models and algorithms\" [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760), indicating the risk originates from the AI's internal processes rather than direct human maliciousness or oversight at the point of failure.\n\nIn contrast, human-caused risks often originate from direct human actions, decisions, or omissions, such as negligence, malicious intent, or errors in judgment. While humans design, deploy, and oversee AI systems, an AI-caused risk manifests through the AI's behavior or output, even if a human decision (e.g., poor design choice) was an upstream factor. The distinction lies in the proximate cause of the harm: is it the AI's autonomous function (e.g., a self-driving car's miscalculation, an AI's unprompted hallucination) or a direct human action (e.g., a human driver's mistake, a human intentionally spreading misinformation)?. [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755)\n\nMitigation strategies for AI-caused risks, as implied by the repository's focus on \"AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\" [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825) and \"AI's inherent safety risks\" [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760), center on improving AI robustness, reliability, and governance. This includes rigorous testing, developing mechanisms to prevent or detect unintended behaviors like hallucinations, and establishing frameworks for accountability when AI systems cause harm.",

      "response": "When AI is deployed, unintentional post-deployment risks typically emerge from various sources, impacting safety and reliability. These risks refer to unforeseen or unintended negative consequences that arise after an AI system has been put into real-world use, not due to malicious intent but rather due to system design flaws, unforeseen interactions, or inherent limitations. [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825)\n\nThe MIT AI Risk Repository documents several categories of such risks. A primary concern is the general safety of AI systems with respect to human life and property, and whether their use will \"create unintended or intended safety issues\" once deployed [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). This highlights a broad category of safety failures stemming from a lack of capability or robustness in AI systems.\n\nA specific and prominent unintentional risk identified is the phenomenon of \"hallucinations\" in generative AI models [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). These models can generate \"untruthful or unreasonable content but present it as if it were a fact, leading to biased and misleading information\" [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). This represents a clear example of an unintentional, AI-caused, post-deployment risk related to unreliable output and misinformation.\n\nTo mitigate these unintentional post-deployment risks, the repository's focus on safety suggests several strategies:\n*   **Robust Testing and Validation:** Comprehensive pre-deployment testing, including real-world simulations and adversarial testing, is crucial to identify and address potential unintended behaviors before they manifest in operational environments.\n*   **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loops:** Post-deployment, continuous monitoring of AI system performance, outputs, and real-world impact is essential. Establishing clear feedback mechanisms allows for rapid identification and correction of unintended issues, such as safety failures or the generation of misleading information.\n*   **Strong Governance Frameworks:** Implementing robust AI safety governance frameworks is vital for managing inherent safety risks and ensuring responsible deployment [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760), [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755). This includes establishing clear accountability, ethical guidelines, and mechanisms for oversight.",
