## Query 2: comparison

**Question:** What's the difference between intentional and unintentional risks?

**Status:** success

**Response:**

Understanding how AI affects safety requires considering the distinction between intentional and unintentional risks. [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755)

When AI is deployed, safety risks typically manifest in two primary ways:

1.  **Unintentional Risks:** These arise from the inherent limitations, design flaws, or unforeseen emergent behaviors of AI systems, not from a deliberate malicious act. The repository documents that AI systems can pose safety issues due to a "lack of capability or robustness," leading to "unintended safety issues" [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). A prominent example is "hallucinations" in generative AI, where "an AI model generates untruthful or unreasonable content but presents it as if it were a fact, leading to biased and misleading information" [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). Such risks are often a consequence of complex model interactions, insufficient training data, or errors in deployment, rather than a programmed intent to cause harm.

2.  **Intentional Risks:** These stem from the deliberate design, programming, or malicious use of AI systems to cause harm or achieve a specific, detrimental outcome. While the provided repository sections do not detail specific examples of *intentional* safety issues, the MIT AI Risk Repository acknowledges the question of whether AI use will create "intended safety issues" [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). This category encompasses scenarios like the malicious deployment of AI for cyberattacks, autonomous weapons systems designed to cause harm, or AI-powered disinformation campaigns crafted to manipulate public opinion. These risks are driven by human intent to leverage AI capabilities for harmful purposes.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
Addressing both types of risks requires a multi-faceted approach. For unintentional risks, mitigation focuses on robust testing, validation, explainability, and continuous monitoring of AI systems to identify and correct flaws [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). Implementing strong "AI Safety Governance Frameworks" is crucial [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755) to ensure models are reliable and their outputs are trustworthy, especially in critical applications where hallucinations or errors could have severe consequences [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). For intentional risks, mitigation involves ethical AI development guidelines, strict access controls, cybersecurity measures, and legal frameworks to prevent and penalize malicious use of AI technologies.

## Query 7: comparison

**Question:** What is the difference between human and AI caused risks?

**Status:** success

**Response:**

When it comes to distinguishing between human and AI-caused risks, several critical considerations emerge from the repository's focus on AI safety. [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825)

**AI-Caused Risks:**
These risks originate directly from the AI system's design, operation, or inherent limitations. The repository documents that AI systems can pose significant safety concerns due to their "lack of capability or robustness" [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). This includes questions like, "Are AI safe with respect to human life and property? Will their use create unintended or intended safety issues?" [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). Such risks manifest when the AI itself, through its algorithms or interactions with the environment, leads to harm or undesirable outcomes. A prominent example is "hallucinations" in generative AI, where the model "generates untruthful or unreasonable content but presents it as if it were a fact, leading to biased and misleading information" [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). These are often unintentional consequences stemming from the AI's internal processes [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760).

**Human-Caused Risks (in the context of AI):**
In contrast, human-caused risks, even when involving AI, stem from human decisions, actions, or inactions. While the repository primarily details risks *from* AI, it implicitly acknowledges human roles in risk creation and mitigation. These risks can include:
*   **Intentional Misuse:** Humans deliberately deploying AI for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks, surveillance, or disinformation campaigns.
*   **Unintentional Human Error:** Flaws introduced during the AI's design, training, or deployment phases by human developers, data scientists, or operators. This could involve biased data selection, inadequate testing, or poor integration into existing systems.
*   **Lack of Oversight or Governance:** Human failure to establish robust regulatory frameworks, ethical guidelines, or safety protocols for AI development and deployment. [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760)

**Key Difference:**
The fundamental difference lies in the **proximate cause** of the risk. AI-caused risks are directly attributable to the AI system's autonomous or semi-autonomous functioning, its algorithms, or its data processing. Human-caused risks, conversely, originate from human intent, negligence, or errors in the lifecycle of AI systems. Understanding this distinction is crucial for effective risk assessment and the development of targeted mitigation strategies. [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755)

**Mitigation:**
Mitigation strategies for AI-caused risks often focus on improving AI robustness, interpretability, and safety mechanisms, as well as developing comprehensive AI safety governance frameworks [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755). For human-caused risks, mitigation involves ethical guidelines, robust regulatory oversight, developer training, and accountability frameworks.

## Query 13: detail

**Question:** Provide full details about the Discrimination & Toxicity domain

**Status:** success

**Response:**

When AI is deployed in various contexts, Discrimination & Toxicity risks typically emerge as significant concerns. This domain addresses how AI systems can perpetuate or amplify unfair biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes and harmful social impacts. [Ethical Issues in the Development of Artificial Intelligence: Recognizing the Risks (Domain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity)](/snippet/RID-05614)

The MIT AI Risk Repository documents that AI systems are only as effective as their training data; if the data contains bias, the AI will manifest that bias [AI Risk Domain: 1.1 > Unfair discrimination and misrepresentation](/snippet/RID-06928). This can lead to AI systems perpetuating current prejudices and discrimination, notably in sensitive areas such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement [AI Risk Domain: 1.1 > Unfair discrimination and misrepresentation](/snippet/RID-06928). For instance, AI systems trained on historical data may inherit and reproduce biases from previous datasets, resulting in judgments that have an unjust impact on specific populations, increasing socioeconomic inequalities and fostering discriminatory practices [AI Risk Domain: 1.1 > Unfair discrimination and misrepresentation](/snippet/RID-06928).

Specific examples include "well-documented cases of AI systems displaying discriminatory behaviour based on race, gender, age, and disability status, causing substantial harm" [Ethical Issues in the Development of Artificial Intelligence: Recognizing the Risks (Domain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity)](/snippet/RID-05614). This risk is amplified as AI systems are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes decisions that can have severe consequences for individuals [Ethical Issues in the Development of Artificial Intelligence: Recognizing the Risks (Domain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity)](/snippet/RID-05614). In generative models, biases can manifest through demographic word prevalence and stereotypical content in massive corpora, where, for example, the over-representation of certain pronouns can influence an LLM’s tendencies regarding gender, nationality, race, religion, and culture [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI](/snippet/RID-05914).

To mitigate these risks, the repository emphasizes the importance of designers creating AI systems that favor justice and actively avoid biases [AI Risk Domain: 1.1 > Unfair discrimination and misrepresentation](/snippet/RID-06928). This involves critical assessment of training data for inherent biases pre-deployment and continuous monitoring for discriminatory outcomes post-deployment. Furthermore, addressing these challenges requires a focus on the ethical education of future AI creators, ensuring they possess not only technical competence but also a strong understanding of ethics and responsibility in AI development.

**Response:**

## Complete AI Risk Repository Taxonomy Structure

## Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks

The AI Risk Repository uses a **Causal Taxonomy** that classifies risks based on three key dimensions:

### 1. **Entity** (Who/what causes the risk?)
- **Human** (39% of risks): Risks caused by human decisions or actions
- **AI** (41% of risks): Risks caused by AI system decisions or actions  
- **Other** (20% of risks): Risks without clearly specified causal entity

### 2. **Intentionality** (Was it intended?)
- **Intentional** (34% of risks): Risk as expected outcome of pursuing a goal
- **Unintentional** (35% of risks): Risk as unexpected outcome
- **Other** (31% of risks): Risk without clearly specified intentionality

### 3. **Timing** (When does it occur?)
- **Pre-deployment** (13% of risks): Risk occurs before the AI model is deployed
- **Post-deployment** (62% of risks): Risk occurs after the AI model has been trained and deployed
- **Other** (25% of risks): Risk without clearly specified timing

This taxonomy allows systematic classification of any AI risk by identifying the causal entity, whether the harm was intentional, and when in the AI lifecycle it occurs.

## Query 19: edge

**Question:** Show the full breakdown of unintentional AI-caused post-deployment risks

**Status:** success

**Response:**

When AI is deployed, unintentional post-deployment risks are a critical area of focus for AI safety. These risks arise from the inherent complexities and limitations of AI systems, manifesting after they are in operation, without malicious intent from the AI or its operators. [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825)

The MIT AI Risk Repository documents several facets of these unintentional, AI-caused, post-deployment risks:. [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760)

**1. Lack of Capability or Robustness:** A primary concern is whether AI systems are safe with respect to human life and property, and if their use will create unintended safety issues [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825). This encompasses scenarios where an AI system, despite its design, fails to perform as expected in real-world conditions, leading to accidents or harm. The repository highlights "lack of capability or robustness" as a sub-domain of AI system safety failures [Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review (Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations)](/snippet/RID-04825).

**2. Unreliable Output and Misinformation:** Generative AI models, in particular, can produce "untruthful or unreasonable content but present it as if it were a fact," a phenomenon known as hallucination [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760). This leads to biased and misleading information, which, when deployed, can have significant safety implications across various domains, from healthcare advice to financial decisions. These "risks from models and algorithms" are categorized as inherent safety risks due to unreliable output [AI Safety Governance Framework (Domain: 3. Misinformation)](/snippet/RID-05760).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
To address these unintentional post-deployment risks, the repository's focus on AI safety governance is paramount [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755). Key mitigation strategies include:
*   **Robust Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly testing AI systems in diverse, real-world scenarios before and after deployment to identify and rectify vulnerabilities related to capability and robustness.
*   **Monitoring and Auditing:** Continuous monitoring of AI system outputs and behaviors post-deployment to detect and correct instances of unreliable information or unintended consequences.
*   **Transparency and Explainability:** Designing AI systems to be more transparent about their decision-making processes can help identify the root causes of unintentional errors.
*   **Human Oversight and Intervention:** Establishing clear protocols for human intervention when AI systems exhibit unsafe or unreliable behavior.

Understanding how AI affects various domains requires considering these inherent safety challenges, ensuring that systems are not only effective but also reliably safe in their operational environments. [AI Safety Governance Framework](/snippet/RID-05755)
