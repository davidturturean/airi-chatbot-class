**Known limitations: (excluded from brief to avoid bias)**

## Current Features (What Works Well)

The chatbot includes several implemented features:

‚úì **Real-time status indicators** during query processing (Initializing ‚Üí Classifying ‚Üí Searching ‚Üí Generating)

‚úì **Streaming responses** (text appears as it\'s generated, not all at once)

‚úì **Session persistence** across widget and full page views

‚úì **Conversation transfer** between widget popup and full page interface

‚úì **Citation system** with clickable links to source documents

‚úì **PostHog analytics** tracking query performance and user interactions

---

## Known Limitations

- Basic interface lacking user guidance and expectation management

- Initial embedding service startup can take 15-30 seconds on first query of the day

- No onboarding or example queries shown to new users to explain chatbot capabilities

- Minimal formatting and visual hierarchy in response presentation

- Unclear link styling and interaction patterns

- Widget may be overlooked by users unfamiliar with floating chat buttons

- Session management requires manual copy/paste of session ID for sharing

- Citation links open in same tab (may disrupt conversation flow)

- No conversation export functionality yet

- Limited mobile optimization (desktop-first design)

**Performance Note:**

Typical response times range from 2-10 seconds depending on query complexity. The system provides real-time status updates during processing:

- üîÑ Initializing the request
- üß† Classifying query intent
- üîç Searching the repository
- ‚ú® Generating response

First-time queries may experience 15-30 second delays while the embedding service initializes. Timeout warnings appear after 15 seconds for unusually long operations.

**Technical Considerations**

System Architecture: The chatbot employs advanced retrieval techniques
including:

- Field-aware hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword
  matching

- Multi-model fallback for enhanced reliability

- Semantic intent classification to optimize response relevance

- Real-time citation consistency validation
