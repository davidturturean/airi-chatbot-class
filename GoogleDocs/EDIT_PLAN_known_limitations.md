# Edit Plan: Known Limitations Document

## Critical Issues Found:
1. **OUTDATED CLAIM**: "Response times of 5-10 seconds without user feedback during processing" (line 5)
   - **REALITY**: Status indicators ARE implemented (üîÑ Initializing, üß† Classifying, üîç Searching, ‚ú® Generating)
2. **Missing**: Current features section (what DOES work)
3. **Missing**: Widget-specific limitations
4. **Missing**: Session transfer limitations
5. **Conflicting info**: Performance note mentions "exploring options" but they're already implemented

---

## Edits to Make:

### EDIT 1: Remove outdated "without user feedback" claim (line 5)
**FIND:**
```markdown
- Response times of 5-10 seconds without user feedback during processing
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```markdown
- Initial embedding service startup can take 15-30 seconds on first query of the day
```

**REASON:** Status indicators exist, so "without feedback" is false. First-time startup IS a real limitation.

---

### EDIT 2: Update Performance Note (lines 14-17)
**FIND:**
```markdown
Performance note: Any current response times of longer-than-average 5-10
seconds reflect the system\'s comprehensive search and validation
processes that can at times be extensive.. We are exploring options for
progress indicators and interim feedback during processing.
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```markdown
**Performance Note:**

Typical response times range from 2-10 seconds depending on query complexity. The system provides real-time status updates during processing:

- üîÑ Initializing the request
- üß† Classifying query intent
- üîç Searching the repository
- ‚ú® Generating response

First-time queries may experience 15-30 second delays while the embedding service initializes. Timeout warnings appear after 15 seconds for unusually long operations.
```

**REASON:** Accurately describes current implementation, mentions status indicators already built

---

### EDIT 3: Add new "Current Features" section BEFORE limitations (after line 1)
**INSERT AFTER LINE 1:**
```markdown

## Current Features (What Works Well)

The chatbot includes several implemented features:

‚úì **Real-time status indicators** during query processing (Initializing ‚Üí Classifying ‚Üí Searching ‚Üí Generating)

‚úì **Streaming responses** (text appears as it's generated, not all at once)

‚úì **Session persistence** across widget and full page views

‚úì **Conversation transfer** between widget popup and full page interface

‚úì **Citation system** with clickable links to source documents

‚úì **PostHog analytics** tracking query performance and user interactions

---

## Known Limitations

```

**REASON:** Users should know what's working before reading limitations. Provides context.

---

### EDIT 4: Add widget/session limitations (after existing limitations)
**INSERT AFTER LINE 12 (after "Unclear link styling and interaction patterns"):**
```markdown

- Widget may be overlooked by users unfamiliar with floating chat buttons

- Session management requires manual copy/paste of session ID for sharing

- Citation links open in same tab (may disrupt conversation flow)

- No conversation export functionality yet

- Limited mobile optimization (desktop-first design)
```

**REASON:** These are real limitations based on current implementation

---

### EDIT 5: Update "Limited context" limitation (line 7-8)
**FIND:**
```markdown
- Limited context provided about the chatbot\'s purpose, scope, and
  capabilities
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```markdown
- No onboarding or example queries shown to new users to explain chatbot capabilities
```

**REASON:** More specific and actionable

---

## Summary of Changes:
1. ‚úÖ Removed "without user feedback" (status indicators exist)
2. ‚úÖ Added "Current Features" section highlighting what works
3. ‚úÖ Updated performance note with accurate timing and status indicator details
4. ‚úÖ Added widget/session-specific limitations
5. ‚úÖ Made "limited context" more specific

## Formatting Notes:
- Preserve escape characters: `\'` for apostrophes
- Preserve markdown bold: `**text**`
- Preserve bullet points formatting
- Add checkmarks using `‚úì` for features list
