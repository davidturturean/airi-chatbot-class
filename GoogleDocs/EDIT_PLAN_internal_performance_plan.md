# Edit Plan: Internal Performance Plan

## Critical Issues Found:
1. **SECURITY**: PostHog API key exposed in line 1
2. **OUTDATED**: "Alternative A: Floating chat widget that expands ‚Üí Idea: implement" (line 57-62) - **WIDGET ALREADY EXISTS**
3. **OUTDATED**: "averaging 2-3 second response times" (line 26) conflicts with "5-10 seconds" in brief
4. **MISSING**: Widget testing objectives in feedback methodology
5. **MISSING**: Session transfer metrics to track
6. **HIGHLIGHTED TEXT**: Multiple `.mark` formatting that should be preserved

---

## Edits to Make:

### EDIT 1: Remove/Redact PostHog API key (line 1)
**FIND:**
```markdown
*PostHog API key: phx_pa5zpKS0q1DTprlpwAaInqlYFIqY2u8iWCKL2C4m2FF5S7M*
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```markdown
*PostHog Analytics: See project dashboard at [https://app.posthog.com/](https://app.posthog.com/)*

*Note: Project API key is already configured in frontend code (`frontend/src/utils/analytics.ts`)*
```

**REASON:** Don't expose API keys unnecessarily in docs. Reference location instead.

---

### EDIT 2: Update "What We Have" section (lines 17-26)
**FIND:**
```markdown
## **What We Have**

‚Ä¢ Chatbot embedded in airisk.mit.edu

‚Ä¢ Direct navigation from main site \"Chatbot\" tab to /chat interface
(no separate homepage for the chatbot)

‚Ä¢ Citation system linking to source documents

‚Ä¢ Diverse query processing [averaging 2-3 second response times]{.mark}
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```markdown
## **What We Have**

‚Ä¢ **Floating chat widget** on all airisk.mit.edu pages with burgundy branding

‚Ä¢ **Full-page chat interface** accessible via /chatbot URL

‚Ä¢ **Session transfer system** enabling conversation continuity between widget ‚Üî full page

‚Ä¢ **Session persistence** via backend API (`/api/session/{id}/messages` endpoints)

‚Ä¢ **Citation system** with clickable RID links to source documents

‚Ä¢ **Real-time status indicators** during query processing (üîÑ Initializing, üß† Classifying, üîç Searching, ‚ú® Generating)

‚Ä¢ **PostHog analytics integration** tracking queries, responses, citations, errors, and session metrics

‚Ä¢ [Response times: 2-10 seconds typical, 15-30 seconds on first query (embedding initialization)]{.mark}
```

**REASON:** Widget exists! Update to reflect current implementation accurately.

---

### EDIT 3: Replace "Interface Design Decisions" section (lines 55-62)
**FIND:**
```markdown
## **2. Interface Design Decisions (not mutually exclusive)**

Current: Full-page embedded chat via iframe

Alternative A: Floating chat widget that expands

‚Üí Idea: implement Alternative A as well, with option to expand to
full-page, and see how the testing for that goes
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```markdown
## **2. Interface Design & User Preference**

**Current Implementation:**

‚Ä¢ Floating widget (popup) on main site pages
‚Ä¢ Full-page interface at /chatbot
‚Ä¢ Session transfer between both interfaces

**Questions to Answer:**

‚Ä¢ Which interface do users prefer for quick questions vs. in-depth research?
‚Ä¢ Is the widget discoverable enough on the main page?
‚Ä¢ Does session transfer work reliably from user perspective?
‚Ä¢ Do users understand they can switch between interfaces?
‚Ä¢ What percentage of users try both vs. stick to one?
```

**REASON:** Widget already implemented - focus on testing preferences, not implementation decisions

---

### EDIT 4: Add widget metrics to "What we will measure" (after line 138)
**INSERT AFTER:**
```markdown
‚Ä¢ [Error rates and timeout frequencies]{.mark}
```

**ADD:**
```markdown

**Widget & Session Transfer Metrics:**

‚Ä¢ [Widget button click rate (how many visitors engage)]{.mark}
‚Ä¢ [Widget ‚Üí Full Page transition rate]{.mark}
‚Ä¢ [Session transfer success rate (messages preserved correctly)]{.mark}
‚Ä¢ [Session ID copy attempts and success]{.mark}
‚Ä¢ [Average time spent in widget vs. full page]{.mark}
‚Ä¢ [Query count comparison: widget-only vs. full-page-only vs. mixed users]{.mark}
```

**REASON:** Need to track widget-specific metrics based on what was built

---

### EDIT 5: Update survey questions to include widget testing (after line 161)
**INSERT AFTER:**
```markdown
7\. [Did you encounter any errors or timeouts? (Yes/No +
details)]{.mark}
```

**ADD:**
```markdown

8\. Did you try both the widget and full page versions? (Yes, both / Only widget / Only full page)

9\. If you tried both, which did you prefer? (Widget / Full page / No preference) [Why?]{.mark}

10\. Was the floating chat button easy to find on the main page? (Yes, immediately / Yes, after looking / No, missed it)

11\. Did the conversation transfer correctly when switching to full page? (Yes, perfectly / Mostly / No, messages were lost / Didn't try)
```

**REASON:** Google Form has these questions - internal doc should match

---

### EDIT 6: Update "Performance metrics for each task" (lines 108-114)
**FIND:**
```markdown
[Performance metrics for each task:]{.mark}

[‚Ä¢ Response time (target \<2s)]{.mark}

[‚Ä¢ Factual accuracy (target \>95%)]{.mark}

[‚Ä¢ Citation validity (100% working links)]{.mark}
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```markdown
[Performance metrics for each task:]{.mark}

[‚Ä¢ Response time (target: \<5s typical, \<15s max excluding first-time init)]{.mark}

[‚Ä¢ Factual accuracy (target \>95%)]{.mark}

[‚Ä¢ Citation validity (target: 100% working links)]{.mark}

[‚Ä¢ Status indicator appearance (target: 100% of queries show progress)]{.mark}
```

**REASON:** <2s target is unrealistic. 2-10s is current performance. Add status indicator metric.

---

### EDIT 7: Add PostHog event reference (after line 165)
**INSERT AFTER:**
```markdown
\+ [Automated performance metrics dashboard with real-time monitoring,
through Railway]{.mark}
```

**ADD:**
```markdown

**PostHog Events Being Tracked:**

‚Ä¢ `chatbot_opened` - Initial widget/page load
‚Ä¢ `query_submitted` - User sends message
‚Ä¢ `response_received` - Bot responds (includes latency_ms, citations_count, response_length)
‚Ä¢ `citation_clicked` - User clicks RID link
‚Ä¢ `error_occurred` - Any errors during query processing
‚Ä¢ `session_ended` - Session summary with total queries and duration
‚Ä¢ `session_transferred` - Widget ‚Üí Full Page transition *(to be added)*

See `frontend/src/utils/analytics.ts` for implementation details.
```

**REASON:** Documents what's already being tracked, identifies what needs to be added

---

## Summary of Changes:
1. ‚úÖ Removed PostHog API key, replaced with dashboard reference
2. ‚úÖ Updated "What We Have" to reflect widget, session transfer, status indicators
3. ‚úÖ Replaced "Alternative A" with current implementation testing questions
4. ‚úÖ Added widget & session transfer metrics section
5. ‚úÖ Added widget-specific survey questions
6. ‚úÖ Updated response time targets to realistic values
7. ‚úÖ Added PostHog events reference

## Formatting Notes:
- **PRESERVE ALL `{.mark}` highlighting** - this is intentional emphasis
- Preserve bold: `**text**`
- Preserve italics: `*text*`
- Preserve escape characters: `\` before special chars
- Preserve numbered list format: `1\.` etc.
