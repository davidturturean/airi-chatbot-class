## IMPORTANT: Background Section Repositioning

### DO NOT add Section 0 (Background) at the beginning

**REASON:** Asking about expertise level FIRST creates selection bias - experts may perform differently knowing they're identified as experts.

### INSTEAD: Add Background questions at the END (after all testing questions)

**New Section 7: Background** (move to end of form, BEFORE final improvements section)

**Q1.** What is your role?
- Graduate Student
- Postdoc
- Faculty
- Research Staff

- Somewhat familiar (basic awareness)
- Not familiar

**Q3.** Have you used the AI Risk Repository database before?
- Yes, frequently
- Yes, a few times
