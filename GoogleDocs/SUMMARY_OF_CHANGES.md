## Document 1: User Testing Brief (Read Before Testing)

### Critical Changes Made:

#### ‚úÖ **Added Time Commitment Section**
- Added upfront ~40-45 minute total time estimate
- Breakdown: 5min setup, 5min Phase 1, 20min Phase 2, 15min Phase 3

#### ‚úÖ **Fixed URL from Railway to Webflow**
**BEFORE:** `https://airi-chatbot-class-production.up.railway.app/chat`
**AFTER:** `https://ai-risk-repository-601932-8fac479478ab1.webflow.io`

**Reason:** Users need to test on Webflow domain where widget is deployed, not Railway directly.

#### ‚úÖ **Added Widget Testing Instructions**
- Explicitly mentions "floating chat button in bottom-right corner"
- Identifies it as "the widget version"

#### ‚úÖ **Completely Rewrote Phase 1 (Initial Impressions)**
**Added widget discoverability testing:**
1. Arrive at page WITHOUT clicking
2. Verbally describe if they see chatbot, where it is, would they click
3. THEN click floating button
4. Explore widget before sending messages

**Reason:** Tests if widget is discoverable - critical UX metric.

#### ‚úÖ **Completely Rewrote Phase 2 (Natural Interaction)**
**Split into two parts:**

**Part A: Widget Testing (7-10 minutes)**
- Ask 2-3 repository questions in widget
- Test Session feature (view ID, copy button)
- Click "Open in Full Page" button

**Part B: Full Page Testing (8-10 minutes)**
- Verify conversation history transferred
- Ask 3-4 more questions (including edge cases)
- Compare widget vs full page experience

**Reason:** Widget and session transfer are major features that need systematic testing.

#### ‚úÖ **Updated Phase 3 Instructions**
- **Explicitly states:** "Stop screen recording now"
- Clarifies recording should stop before form (avoid personal info)
- Breaks down into 3 numbered steps

**Reason:** Clearer instructions prevent confusion about recording scope.

## Document 2: Known Limitations (Read After Testing)

### Critical Changes Made:

#### ‚úÖ **Added "Current Features" Section**
**NEW section added at top:**
- ‚úì Real-time status indicators (üîÑ Initializing ‚Üí üß† Classifying ‚Üí üîç Searching ‚Üí ‚ú® Generating)
- ‚úì Streaming responses
- ‚úì Session persistence
- ‚úì Conversation transfer (widget ‚Üî full page)
- ‚úì Citation system with clickable links
- ‚úì PostHog analytics

**Reason:** Users should know what WORKS before reading limitations. Provides positive context.

#### ‚úÖ **Removed OUTDATED Claim About Status Feedback**
**DELETED:** "Response times of 5-10 seconds without user feedback during processing"

**Reason:** This was FALSE. Status indicators ARE implemented (see ChatContext.tsx lines 265-324).

#### ‚úÖ **Updated Performance Note**
**BEFORE:** "We are exploring options for progress indicators and interim feedback"

**AFTER:** Detailed explanation of:
- Typical 2-10 second response times
- Real-time status indicators with icons
- 15-30 second first-time delays (embedding init)
- Timeout warnings after 15 seconds

**Reason:** Accurately describes current implementation, not future plans.

#### ‚úÖ **Added Widget/Session Limitations**
**NEW limitations added:**
- Widget may be overlooked by users unfamiliar with floating buttons
- Session management requires manual copy/paste
- Citation links open in same tab (disrupts flow)
- No conversation export yet
- Limited mobile optimization

**Reason:** These are real limitations based on what was built.

#### ‚úÖ **Made "Limited Context" More Specific**
**BEFORE:** "Limited context provided about chatbot's purpose, scope, capabilities"
**AFTER:** "No onboarding or example queries shown to new users"

**Reason:** More actionable and specific.

---

## Document 3: Internal Performance Plan

### Critical Changes Made:

#### üîí **REMOVED PostHog API Key (Security)**
**DELETED:** `phx_pa5zpKS0q1DTprlpwAaInqlYFIqY2u8iWCKL2C4m2FF5S7M`

**REPLACED WITH:**
- Link to PostHog dashboard
- Reference to code file where key is stored

**Reason:** Don't expose API keys in shared docs unnecessarily.

#### ‚úÖ **Updated "What We Have" Section**
**BEFORE:** Listed only full-page chat, cited "2-3 second response times"

**AFTER:** Comprehensive list:
- **Floating chat widget** with burgundy branding
- **Full-page interface** at /chatbot
- **Session transfer system** (widget ‚Üî full page)
- **Session persistence** via backend API
- **Citation system** with RID links
- **Real-time status indicators**
- **PostHog analytics integration**
- Response times: 2-10s typical, 15-30s first query

**Reason:** Widget EXISTS! Internal doc was outdated.

#### ‚úÖ **Replaced "Interface Design Decisions" Section**
**DELETED:** "Alternative A: Floating chat widget that expands ‚Üí Idea: implement"

**Why deleted:** Widget is already implemented!

**REPLACED WITH:** "Interface Design & User Preference"
- Current implementation (widget + full page + session transfer)
- Questions to answer via testing (which do users prefer, is widget discoverable, etc.)

**Reason:** Focus on testing what exists, not deciding what to build.

#### ‚úÖ **Added Widget & Session Transfer Metrics**
**NEW metrics section added:**
- Widget button click rate
- Widget ‚Üí Full Page transition rate
- Session transfer success rate
- Session ID copy attempts/success
- Time spent: widget vs full page
- Query count: widget-only vs full-page-only vs mixed users

**Reason:** Need to track widget-specific performance.

#### ‚úÖ **Added Widget Questions to Survey**
**NEW questions 8-11:**
8. Did you try both widget and full page?
9. Which did you prefer and why?
10. Was floating button easy to find?
11. Did conversation transfer work?

**Reason:** Aligns with Google Form additions and User Testing Brief.

#### ‚úÖ **Updated Performance Targets**
**BEFORE:** `Response time (target <2s)`
**AFTER:** `Response time (target: <5s typical, <15s max excluding first-time init)`

**Also added:** `Status indicator appearance (target: 100% of queries show progress)`

**Reason:** <2s is unrealistic. Current performance is 2-10s. Status indicators are implemented.

#### ‚úÖ **Added PostHog Events Documentation**
**NEW section documenting tracked events:**
- `chatbot_opened` - Initial widget/page load
- `query_submitted` - User sends message
- `response_received` - Bot responds (with latency, citations, length)
- `citation_clicked` - User clicks RID link
- `error_occurred` - Errors during query
- `session_ended` - Session summary
- `session_transferred` - Widget ‚Üí Full Page *(to be added)*

**With reference:** `See frontend/src/utils/analytics.ts`

**Reason:** Documents what's being tracked, identifies what needs to be added.
