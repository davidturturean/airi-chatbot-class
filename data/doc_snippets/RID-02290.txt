In part, this is due to unavailability of training data: there are many widely spoken languages for which no systematic efforts have been made to create labelled training datasets, such as Javanese which is spoken by more than 80 million people [95]. Training data is particularly missing for languages that are spoken by groups who are multilingual and can use a technology in English, or for languages spoken by groups who are not the primary target demographic for new technologies."\nAdditional Evidence: "Training data can also be lacking when relatively little digitised text is available in a language, e.g. Seychellois Creole [95].
