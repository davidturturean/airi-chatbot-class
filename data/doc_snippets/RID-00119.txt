Title: Mapping the Ethics of Generative AI: A Comprehensive Scoping Review\nDomain: 2. Privacy & Security\nSub-domain: 2.1 > Compromise of privacy by leaking or correctly inferring sensitive information\nRisk Category: Privacy\nDescription: Generative AI systems, similar to traditional machine learning methods, are considered a threat to privacy and data protection norms. A major concern is the intended extraction or inadvertent leakage of sensitive or private information from LLMs. To mitigate this risk, strategies such as sanitizing training data to remove sensitive information or employing synthetic data for training are proposed.\nEntity: 3 - Other\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 3 - Other
