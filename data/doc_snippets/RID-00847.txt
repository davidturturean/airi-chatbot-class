Title: Generating Harms - Generative AI's impact and paths forwards\nDomain: 4. Malicious Actors & Misuse\nSub-domain: 4.3 > Fraud, scams, and targeted manipulation\nRisk Category: Harassment, Impersonation, and Extortion\nRisk Subcategory: Privacy and consent\nDescription: "Even when a victim of targeted, AIgenerated harms successfully identifies a deepfake creator with malicious intent, they may still struggle to redress many harms because the generated image or video isn’t the victim, but instead a composite image or video using aspects of multiple sources to create a believable, yet fictional, scene. At their core, these AI-generated images and videos circumvent traditional notions of privacy and consent: because they rely on public images and videos, like those posted on social media websites, they often don’t rely on any private information."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 1 - Intentional\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
