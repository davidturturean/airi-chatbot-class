Privacy & Security\nSub-domain: 2.1 > Compromise of privacy by leaking or correctly inferring sensitive information\nRisk Category: Systemic risks\nRisk Subcategory: Risks to privacy\nDescription: "General- purpose AI systems can cause or contribute to violations of user privacy. Violations can occur inadvertently during the training or usage of AI systems, for example through unauthorised processing of personal data or leaking health records used in training. But violations can also happen deliberately through the use of general- purpose AI by malicious actors; for example, if they use AI to infer private facts or violate security."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 3 - Other
