scqa_situation: clude ‘phase transitions’, where a gradual change in individual connections or network structure triggers a sudden and dramatic shift in the behaviour of the entire network (Newman, 2003, see also Section 3.4). Such changes might occur naturally (e.g., in global trade networks as the transition from expensive human-human interactions to cheaper AI-AI interactions leads to many new connections between sellers and buyers) or artificially (e.g., if a model developer makes an update that inadvertently connects or disconnects a vast number of downstream agents and applications). While such problems are already present in existing systems (Gao et al., 2016; Vi ́e & Morales, 2021), the increased size, speed, and density of AI-based netwo
