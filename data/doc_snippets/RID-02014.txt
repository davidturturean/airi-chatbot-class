Title: Multi-Agent Risks from Advanced AI\nRisk Category: Information Asymmetries\nAdditional Evidence: "A key aspect of many multi-agent systems is that some agents might possess knowledge that others do not. These information asymmetries can result from constraints on information exchange or from strategic behaviour and can lead to cooperation failures in both common-interest and mixed-motive settings. Despite their information processing capabilities, AI agents remain vulnerable to failures caused by information asymmetries."
