Title: Ten Hard Problems in Artificial Intelligence We Must Get Right\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.2 > Increased inequality and decline in employment quality\nRisk Category: Negative impacts of AI use\nRisk Subcategory: Under-recognized work\nDescription: "Without training data, ML cannot take place. Much of this data comes from paid clickwork (also called “platform work” [170] or “microwork” [558]), unpaid crowdsourcing, and unpaid user behavior capture. Clickworkers, mainly in the global south, perform repetitive data-labeling tasks for use in the training of ML models [558]. The market value of such annotations “is projected to reach $13.7 billion by 2030” [228] and the annotation industry is widely reported to have little concern for workers’ rights. Besides welfare and rights, the invisibility of this contribution arguably contributes to a misunderstanding of AI capabilities.7"\nEntity: 3 - Other\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 1 - Pre-deployment
