Title: Examining the differential risk from high-level artificial intelligence and the question of control
Domain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental
Sub-domain: 6.0 > Socioeconomic & Environmental
Risk Category: Structural
Description: "Structural risks are concerned with how AI technologies "shape and are shaped by the environments in which they are developed and deployed""
Additional Evidence: "One structural risk that is evaluated less frequently is the potential for automated systems to upend the stability of strategic weapons systems through the erosion of confidence. For example, alterations to behavioral regimes, such as nuclear rapprochement, can compromise trust and increase uncertainty"
