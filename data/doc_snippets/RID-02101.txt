Privacy & Security\nSub-domain: 2.2 > AI system security vulnerabilities and attacks\nRisk Category: Misuse tactics to compromise GenAI systems (Model integrity)\nRisk Subcategory: Model extraction\nDescription: "Data Exfiltration goes beyond revealing private information, and involves illicitly obtaining the training data used to build a model that may be sensitive or proprietary. Model Extraction is the same attack, only directed at the model instead of the training data â€” it involves obtaining the architecture, parameters, or hyper-parameters of a proprietary model (Carlini et al., 2024)."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 1 - Intentional\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
