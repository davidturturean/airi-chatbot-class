Title: Regulating under Uncertainty: Governance Options for Generative AI\nDomain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\nSub-domain: 7.4 > Lack of transparency or interpretability\nRisk Category: Technical and operational risks\nRisk Subcategory: Opacity (the black box problem)\nDescription: "Opacity surrounding the technical, internal decision-making processes of generative AI models is popularly known as the “black box problem.”277 Generative AI models, most ubiquitously built on deep neural networks with hundreds of billions of internal connections,278 have become so complex that their internal decision-making processes are no longer traceable or interpretable to even the most advanced expert observers. This means that, while the inputs and outputs of a system can be observed, developers cannot explain in detail why specific inputs correspond to specific outputs."\nEntity: 3 - Other\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 3 - Other
