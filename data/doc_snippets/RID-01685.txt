Title: International AI Safety Report 2025\nRisk Category: Risks from malicious use\nRisk Subcategory: Cyber offence\nAdditional Evidence: "Offensive cyber operations typically involve designing and deploying malicious software (malware) and exploiting vulnerabilities in software and hardware systems, leading to severe security breaches. A standard attack chain begins with reconnaissance of the target system, followed by iterative discovery, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and additional information gathering. These actions demand careful planning and strategic execution to achieve the adversary's objectives while avoiding detection. Some experts are concerned that general- purpose AI could enhance these operations by automating vulnerability detection, optimising attack strategies, and improving evasion techniques (348, 349). These advanced capabilities would benefit all attackers. For instance, state actors could leverage them to target critical national infrastructure (CNI), resulting in widespread disruption and significant damage. At the same time, general- purpose AI could also be used defensively, for example to find and fix vulnerabilities."
