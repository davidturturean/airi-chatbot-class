scqa_answer: As GAI systems often involve many distinct third-party components and data sources, it may be difficult to attribute issues in a system’s behavior to any one of these sources
scqa_complication: , it may be difficult to attribute issues in a system’s behavior to any one of these sources."

scqa_situation: ial Intelligence Profile\nRisk Category: Value Chain and Component Integration\nAdditional Evidence: "GAI value chains involve many third-party components such as procured datasets, pre-trained models, and software libraries. These components might be improperly obtained or not properly vetted, leading to diminished transparency or accountability for downstream users. While this is a risk for traditional AI systems and some other digital technologies, the risk is exacerbated for GAI due to the scale of the traini

Title: Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile\nRisk Category: Value Chain and Component Integration\nAdditional Evidence: "GAI value chains involve many third-party components such as procured datasets, pre-trained models, and software libraries. These components might be improperly obtained or not properly vetted, leading to diminished transparency or accountability for downstream users. While this is a risk for traditional AI systems and some other digital technologies, the risk is exacerbated for GAI due to the scale of the training data, which may be too large for humans to vet; the difficulty of training foundation models, which leads to extensive reuse of limited numbers of models; and the extent to which GAI may be integrated into other devices and services. As GAI systems often involve many distinct third-party components and data sources, it may be difficult to attribute issues in a system’s behavior to any one of these sources."
