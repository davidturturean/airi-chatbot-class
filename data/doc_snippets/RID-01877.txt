Title: Risk Sources and Risk Management Measures in Support of Standards for General-Purpose AI Systems\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.5 > Governance failure\nRisk Category: Model Evaluations\nRisk Subcategory: Benchmark Limitations (Insufficient benchmarks for AI safety evaluation)\nDescription: "Benchmarks dedicated to measuring the performance of AI systems (e.g., on programming or math tasks) are more well-developed than those for assessing safety and harms in AI systems [234]. This gap can lead to AI systems excelling in specific tasks while exhibiting harmful behaviors that go undetected. More safety-related evaluation datasets can help in identifying previously overlooked undesirable model behaviors."\nEntity: 3 - Other\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 1 - Pre-deployment
