AI Risk Domain: 7.4 > Lack of transparency or interpretability\n\nThis domain contains 41 risk entries from the AI Risk Repository:\n\nRisk Entry 1:\nTitle: Mapping the Ethics of Generative AI: A Comprehensive Scoping Review\nDomain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\nSub-domain: 7.4 > Lack of transparency or interpretability\nRisk Category: Transparency - Explainability\nDescription: Being a multifaceted concept, the term 'transparency' is both used to refer to technical explainability as well as organizational openness. Regarding the former, papers underscore the need for mechanistic interpretability and for explaining internal mechanisms in generative models. On the organizational front, transparency relates to practices such as informing users about capabilities and shortcomings of models, as well as adhering to documentation and reporting requirements for data collection processes or risk evaluations.\nEntity: 4 - Not coded\nIntent: 4 - Not coded\nTiming: 4 - Not
