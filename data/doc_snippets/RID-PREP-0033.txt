Domain totals may not match subdomain sums due to rounding and domain-level coding of some risks. We find that papers varied significantly in terms of which risk domains they examined. The domain of Socioeconomic & Environmental was the most common, with 76% of the documents mentioning at least one of the subdomains, and 19% of all risks in the database coded against this domain. Risks aligned with the AI system safety, failures, & limitations domain were mentioned in 75% of papers (26% total risks). Risks aligned with the Malicious actors & misuse domain were mentioned in 71% of papers (16% total risks). The least common domain of risk was Misinformation (46% of papers, 4% total risks). The most common subdomains of risk (mentioned in >50% of included documents) were 1.1 Unfair discrimination and misrepresentation, 2.1 Compromise of privacy, 7.3 Lack of capability or robustness, 4.2 Cyberattacks, weapon development or use, and mass harm and 4.1 Disinformation, surveillance, and influence at scale. The least frequently mentioned risks (mentioned in â‰¤20% of included documents) were 7.5 AI welfare and rights, 7.6 Multi-agent risks, 3.2 Pollution of information ecosystem and loss of consensus reality, 1.3 Unequal performance across groups and 6.4 Competitive dynamics. Domains of AI risks examined by included documents Papers varied significantly in terms of which domains of AI risk they examined. Several documents discussed risks from all seven domains (e.g., Hagendorff, 2024). Other papers investigated only 1-2 domains of AI risk (e.g., Ji et al., 2023). The average document examined 66% of the domains identified, as shown in Table 8. Table 8.
