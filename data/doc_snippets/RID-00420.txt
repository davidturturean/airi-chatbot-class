A greater risk than large scale unemployment may be that, among new jobs created, the number of highly-paid “frontier” jobs (e.g. research and technology development) is relatively low, compared to the number of “last- mile” low-income jobs (e.g. monitoring the predictions of an LM application) (Autor and Salomons, 2019). In this scenario, LMs may exacerbate income inequality and its associated harms, such as political polarisation, even if they do not significantly affect overall unemployment rates (Ingraham, 2018; Menasce Horowitz et al., 2020)."
