Title: International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI\nRisk Category: Systemic Risks\nRisk Subcategory: Risks to the environment\nAdditional Evidence: "Today, data centres, servers and data transmission networks account for between 1% to 1.5% of global electricity demand (578); roughly 2% in the EU, 4% in the US, and close to 3% in China (69, 579, 580). AI likely accounts for well under half of data centre electricity consumption currently, but if the rapid growth of AI's computational requirements continues, AI could become the primary consumer of data centre electricity over the coming years and increase its share of global electricity demand.
