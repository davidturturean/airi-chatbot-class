Title: The Risks of Machine Learning Systems\nRisk Category: First-Order Risks\nRisk Subcategory: Misapplication\nAdditional Evidence: "Ability to prevent misuse: The ability to prevent misuse before it occurs significantly reduces misapplication risk. In
the case of autonomous vehicles, the car might be programmed to automatically slow to a stop if individuals remove their hands from the wheel or if there is a significant weight decrease in the driverâ€™s seat while the car is in motion.
However, while such failsafes significantly reduce risk, they do not entirely eliminate it since they can be bypassed [9]."
