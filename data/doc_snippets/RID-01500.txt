Title: A Survey of the Potential Long-term Impacts of AI: How AI Could Lead to Long-term Changes in Science, Cooperation, Power, Epistemics and Values\nDomain: 4. Malicious Actors & Misuse\nSub-domain: 4.1 > Disinformation, surveillance, and influence at scale\nRisk Category: Increased power concentration and inequality\nRisk Subcategory: Developments in AI enable actors to undermine democratic processes\nDescription: "Developments in AI are giving companies and governments more control over individualsâ€™ lives than ever before, and may possibly be used to undermine democratic processes. We are already seeing how the collection of large amounts of personal data can be used to surveil and influence populations, for example the use of facial recognition technology to surveil Uighur and other minority populations in China [66]. Further advances in language modelling could also be used to develop tools that can effectively persuade people of certain claims [42]."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 1 - Intentional\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
