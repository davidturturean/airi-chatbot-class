Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.5 > Governance failure\nRisk Category: Capability failures\nRisk Subcategory: Difficult to develop metrics for evaluating benefits or harms caused by AI assistants\nDescription: "Another difficulty facing AI assistant systems is that it is challenging to develop metrics for evaluating particular aspects of benefits or harms caused by the assistant – especially in a sufficiently expansive sense, which could involve much of society (see Chapter 19). Having these metrics is useful both for assessing the risk of harm from the system and for using the metric as a training signal."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 1 - Pre-deployment
