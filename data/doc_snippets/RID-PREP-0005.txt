foundation to build on for complex projects. Informing the development of narrower or more specific taxonomies. (e.g., systemic risks, or EU-related misinformation risks). Using the taxonomy for prioritization (e.g., with expert ratings), synthesis (e.g, for a review) or comparison (e.g., exploring public concern across domains). Identifying underrepresented areas (e.g., AI welfare and rights). Specific: Policymakers: Regulation and shared standard development. Auditors: Developing AI system audits and standards. Academics: Identifying research gaps and developing education and training. Industry: Internally evaluating and preparing for risks, and developing related strategy, education and training.

Insights from Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks 63 Table 13. Insights from Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks 63 Introduction Risks from Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, regulators, policymakers, and the public (Center for AI Safety, 2023; UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2023a, 2023b). The Responsible AI Collaborative’s AI Incident Database now includes over 3,000 real-world instances where AI systems have caused or nearly caused harm (McGregor, 2020). Research and investment in the development and deployment of increasingly capable AI systems has accelerated (Maslej et al., 2024). Concurrent with this attention, researchers and practitioners have sought to understand, evaluate, and address the risks associated with these systems. This work has so far produced a diverse and disparate set of taxonomies, classifications, and other lists of AI risks.
