Title: Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile\nRisk Category: Human-AI Configuration\nAdditional Evidence: "GAI system use can involve varying risks of misconfigurations and poor interactions between a system and a human who is interacting with it. Humans bring their unique perspectives, experiences, or domain- specific expertise to interactions with AI systems but may not have detailed knowledge of AI systems and how they work. As a result, human experts may be unnecessarily “averse” to GAI systems, and thus deprive themselves or others of GAI’s beneficial uses."
