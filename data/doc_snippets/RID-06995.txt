What we did



Figure A. Overview of Study Methodology

As shown in Figure A, we used a systematic search strategy, forwards and backwards searching, and expert consultation to identify AI risk classifications, frameworks, and taxonomies. Specifically, we searched several academic databases for relevant research and then used pre-specified rules to define which research would be included in our summary. Next, we consulted experts (i.e., the authors of the included documents) to suggest additional research we should include. Finally, we reviewed i) the bibliographies of the research identified in the first and second stages, and ii) papers that referenced that research to find further relevant documents.
