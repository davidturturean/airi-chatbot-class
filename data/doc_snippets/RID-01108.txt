Privacy & Security\nSub-domain: 2.2 > AI system security vulnerabilities and attacks\nRisk Category: AI's inherent safety risks\nRisk Subcategory: Risks from AI systems (Risks of exploitation through defects and backdoors)\nDescription: "The standardized API, feature libraries, toolkits used in the design, training, and verification stages of AI algorithms and models, development interfaces, and execution platforms may contain logical flaws and vulnerabilities. These weaknesses can be exploited, and in some cases, backdoors can be intentionally embedded, posing significant risks of being triggered and used for attacks."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 3 - Other
