Title: Ethical Issues in the Development of Artificial Intelligence: Recognizing the Risks
Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations
Sub-domain: 7.4 > Lack of transparency or interpretability
Risk Category: Transparency and explainability
Description: "A recurring complaint among participants was a lack of knowledge about how AI systems made judgements. They emphasized the significance of making AI systems more visible and explainable so that people may have confidence in their outputs and hold them accountable for their activities. Because AI systems are typically opaque, making it difficult for users to understand the rationale behind their judgements, ethical concerns about AI, as well as issues of transparency and explainability, arise. This lack of understanding can generate suspicion and reluctance to adopt AI technology, as well as making it harder to hold AI systems accountable for their actions."
