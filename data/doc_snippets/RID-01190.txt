Title: Regulating under Uncertainty: Governance Options for Generative AI\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.1 > Power centralization and unfair distribution of benefits\nRisk Category: Environmental, economical, and societal challenges\nRisk Subcategory: Concentration of market power (Trend toward market concentration)\nDescription: "In the generative AI market, barriers to entry are very high. Developers need access to vast volumes of data, computational resources, technical expertise, and capital. Large technology companies with such access are able to exploit economies of scale, economies of scope, and feedback effects (learning effects from user- generated data).542 All this gives them an overwhelming advantage over smaller companies, making competition increasingly challenging for these smaller entities."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 1 - Intentional\nTiming: 3 - Other
