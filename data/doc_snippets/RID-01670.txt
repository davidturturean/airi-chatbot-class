Title: AI Hazard Management: A Framework for the Systematic Management of Root Causes for AI Risks\nSub-domain: X.1 > Excluded\nRisk Category: Mode\nRisk Subcategory: Socio-technical\nDescription: "In contrast to technical AI hazards, socio-technical hazards also require hu- man input related to social and cultural aspects [45]. Human judgment must be employed when deciding on quantification and treatment methods. For instance, AI hazards concerning discrimination and privacy, which are abstract concepts lacking a uniform technical definition, further complicate a clear quantification of the associated risks. Although quantitative methods exist to assess and treat these AI hazards, they require coordination with social and cultural values [27]."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 3 - Other
