Title: International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.2 > Increased inequality and decline in employment quality\nRisk Category: Systemic Risks\nRisk Subcategory: Labour market risks\nDescription: "Unlike previous waves of automation, general- purpose AI has the potential to automate a very broad range of tasks, which could have a significant effect on the labour market. This could mean many people could lose their current jobs. Labour market frictions, such as the time needed for workers to learn new skills or relocate for new jobs, could cause unemployment in the short run even if overall labour demand remained unchanged."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
