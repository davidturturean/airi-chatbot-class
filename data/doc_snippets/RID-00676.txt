Title: The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants\nDomain: 5. Human-Computer Interaction\nSub-domain: 5.1 > Overreliance and unsafe use\nRisk Category: Risk of Harm through Anthropomorphic AI Assistant Design\nDescription: "Although unlikely to cause harm in isolation, anthropomorphic perceptions of advanced AI assistants may pave the way for downstream harms on individual and societal levels. We document observed or likely individual level harms of interacting with highly anthropomorphic AI assistants, as well as the potential larger-scale, societal implications of allowing such technologies to proliferate without restriction.
