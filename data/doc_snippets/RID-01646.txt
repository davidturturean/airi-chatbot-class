Title: AI Hazard Management: A Framework for the Systematic Management of Root Causes for AI Risks\nDomain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity\nSub-domain: 1.1 > Unfair discrimination and misrepresentation\nRisk Category: Discriminative data bias\nDescription: "Discriminative data bias describes the systematic discrimination of groups of persons in the form of data shortcomings, such as distributional representation or incorrectness. Data bias can manifest in the model and lead to unfair decisions if not appropriately treated. Note, that the term bias is often used in other contexts, such as data representation. However, these issues are treated by other AI hazards in this list."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
