Title: Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile\nRisk Category: Environmental Impacts\nAdditional Evidence: "Current estimates suggest that training a single transformer LLM can emit as much carbon as 300 round- trip flights between San Francisco and New York. In a study comparing energy consumption and carbon emissions for LLM inference, generative tasks (e.g., text summarization) were found to be more energy- and carbon-i ntensive than discriminative or non-generative tasks (e.g., text classification"
