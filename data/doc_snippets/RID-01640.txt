Title: AI Hazard Management: A Framework for the Systematic Management of Root Causes for AI Risks\nDomain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\nSub-domain: 7.3 > Lack of capability or robustness\nRisk Category: Inadequate planning of performance requirements\nDescription: "The expected performance of the AI system should be planned adequately. Hereby, an important aspect is that chosen performance metrics are meaningful for presenting the intended functionality. Otherwise, expectations and safety requirements can be unfulfillable at later life cycle stages."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 1 - Pre-deployment
