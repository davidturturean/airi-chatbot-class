Title: Risk Sources and Risk Management Measures in Support of Standards for General-Purpose AI Systems\nDomain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\nSub-domain: 7.2 > AI possessing dangerous capabilities\nRisk Category: Agency (Persuasive capabilities)\nDescription: "GPAI systems can produce outputs (such as natural language text, audio, or video) that convince their users of incorrect information. This can happen through personalized persuasion in dialogue, or the mass-production of mis- leading information that is then disseminated over the internet. The persuasive capabilities of GPAI models can sometimes scale with model size or capability [32, 172]. Persuasive models could have larger societal implications by being misused to generate convincing but manipulative or untruthful content."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 1 - Intentional\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
