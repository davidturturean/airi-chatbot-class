            The Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks adapted from Weidinger (2022) classifies risks into 7 AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination & Toxicity, (2) Privacy & Security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious Actors & Misuse, (5) Human-Computer Interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & Environmental, and (7) AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations.  These are further divided into 24 subdomains.
