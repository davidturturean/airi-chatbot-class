Title: Risk Sources and Risk Management Measures in Support of Standards for General-Purpose AI Systems\nSub-domain: X.1 > Excluded\nRisk Category: Dimension - Technical Attributes (AI inadequacy - technical failure)\nRisk Subcategory: Reinforcement learning AI (Training design related)\nDescription: "As above, there are broadly two dimensions of technical failure modes: quality of data or input signal, and training performance. Due to a lack of transparency, it may be difficult to ascertain the type of technical failure that gives rise to a particular risk, and it is often a combination of several factors. Risks pertain- ing to AI failures are exacerbated by poor quality training data and imperfect training signals. Various measures can be implemented to improve the quality of the training data, and fine-tuning techniques can be used to disincentivize harmful model behavior."\nEntity: 3 - Other\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 1 - Pre-deployment
