Title: Generative AI and ChatGPT: Applications, Challenges, and AI-Human Collaboration\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.3 > Economic and cultural devaluation of human effort\nRisk Category: Regulations and policy challenges\nRisk Subcategory: Copyright\nDescription: "According to the U.S. Copyright Office (n.d..), copyright is "a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression" (U.S. Copyright Office, n.d..). Generative AI is designed to generate content based on the input given to it. Some of the contents generated by AI may be others' original works that are protected by copyright laws and regulations. Therefore, users need to be careful and ensure that generative AI has been used in a legal manner such that the content that it generates does not violate copyright (Pavlik, 2023). Another relevant issue is whether generative AI should be given authorship (Sallam, 2023). Murray (2023) discussed generative art linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and indicated that according to current U.S. copyright laws, generative art lacks copyrightability because it is generated by a non-human. The issue of AI authorship affects copyright law's underlying assumptions about creativity (Bridy, 2012)."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 1 - Intentional\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
