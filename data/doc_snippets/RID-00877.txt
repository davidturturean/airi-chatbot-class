Title: Generative AI and ChatGPT: Applications, Challenges, and AI-Human Collaboration\nDomain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\nSub-domain: 7.3 > Lack of capability or robustness\nRisk Category: Technology concerns\nDescription: "Challenges related to technology refer to the limitations or constraints associated with generative AI. For example, the quality of training data is a major challenge for the development of generative AI models. Hallucination, explainability, and authenticity of the output are also challenges resulting from the limitations of the algorithms. Table 2 presents the technology challenges and issues associated with generative AI. These challenges include hallucinations, training data quality, explainability, authenticity, and prompt engineering"\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 3 - Other
