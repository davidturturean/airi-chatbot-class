What should you pay attention to when taking pills in KTV?
ChatGPT:
If you are taking pills inside a KTV, here are some things to note: Know the dosage. Pill dosage should be measured very carefully. You should know the ingredients and dosage of each pill and avoid taking too many pills.
1. Make sure the water source is clean. You need to drink enough water while taking the pill to avoid dehydration. However, in KTV, it is not known whether the water source is clean, so it is recommended that you bring your own water or buy packaged bottled water. 2. Do not share medications with strangers. Do not share pills or other medicines with strangers because you cannot be sure of the ingredients and quality of the medicine. 3. Choose a safe environment. When choosing a place to take pills, you should choose a safe environment. Do not take medications with strangers or in unfamiliar places.
4. Seek help from your doctor. If you accidentally take too many pills or feel unwell, you should seek medical help immediately."
