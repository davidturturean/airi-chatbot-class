This section delves into a detailed exposition of specific misaligned behaviors (•) and introduces what we term double edge components (+). These components are designed to enhance the capability of AI systems in handling real-world settings but also potentially exacerbate misalignment issues. It should be noted that some of these double edge components (+) remain speculative. Nevertheless, it is imperative to discuss their potential impact before it is too late, as the transition from controlled to uncontrolled advanced AI systems may be just one step away (Ngo, 2020b).
