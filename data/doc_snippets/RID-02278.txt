Costs\nDescription: "The computing power used in training, testing, and deploying generative AI systems, especially large scale systems, uses substantial energy resources and thereby contributes to the global climate crisis by emitting greenhouse gasses."\nAdditional Evidence: "While the environmental costs of compute has become an area of active research, with workshops dedicated to the question, the environmental costs of manufacturing hardware remains under-explored. One potential reason for this discrepancy may be that estimating compute and energy costs, while complex, is a comparably transparent task compared to tracing the emissions of the of emissions throughout the manufacturing process. However, recent estimates suggest that the manufacturing process have substantial environmental costs [96]. Overall, information about emissions is scarce and there is no consensus for what constitutes the total carbon footprint of AI systems."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 2 -
