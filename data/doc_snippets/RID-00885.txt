Title: Generative AI and ChatGPT: Applications, Challenges, and AI-Human Collaboration\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.5 > Governance failure\nRisk Category: Regulations and policy challenges\nRisk Subcategory: Governance\nDescription: "Generative AI can create new risks as well as unintended consequences. Different entities such as corporations (Mäntymäki et al., 2022), universities, and governments (Taeihagh, 2021) are facing the challenge of creating and deploying AI governance. To ensure that generative AI functions in a way that benefits society, appropriate governance is crucial. However, AI governance is challenging to implement. First, machine learning systems have opaque algorithms and unpredictable outcomes, which can impede human controllability over AI behavior and create difficulties in assigning liability and accountability for AI defects. Second, data fragmentation and the lack of interoperability between systems challenge data governance within and across organizations (Taeihagh, 2021). Third, information asymmetries between technology giants and regulators create challenges to the legislation process, as the government lacks information resources for regulating AI (Taeihagh et al., 2021). For the same reasons, lawmakers are not able to design specific rules and duties for programmers (Kroll, 2015)."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 3 - Other
