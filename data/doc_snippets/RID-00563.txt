Title: An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks\nRisk Category: AI Race (Environmental/Structural)\nRisk Subcategory: Corporate AI Race\nAdditional Evidence: "Selfish behaviors may erode safety measures that some of us implement. AIs that gain influence and provide economic value will predominate, while AIs that adhere to the most constraints will be less competitive. For example, AIs following the constraint “never break the law” have fewer options than AIs following the constraint “don’t get caught breaking the law.""
