Title: International AI Safety Report 2025\nRisk Category: Risks from malicious use\nRisk Subcategory: Cyber offence\nAdditional Evidence: "General- purpose AI offers significant dual- use cyber capabilities. Evidence indicates that general- purpose AI could accelerate processes such as discovering vulnerabilities, which are essential for launching attacks as well as strengthening defences. However, resource constraints and regulations may prevent critical services and smaller organisations from adopting AI- enhanced defences. The ultimate impact of AI on the attacker- defender balance remains unclear."
