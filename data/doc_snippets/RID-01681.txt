Title: International AI Safety Report 2025\nRisk Category: Risks from malicious use\nRisk Subcategory: Manipulation of public opinion\nAdditional Evidence: "General-purpose AI can generate potentially persuasive content at unprecedented scale and with a high degree of sophistication. Previously, generating content to manipulate public opinion often involved a strong trade- off between quality and quantity. General- purpose AI outputs, however, are often indistinguishable to people from content generated by humans, and generating them is extremely cheap. Some studies have also found them to be as persuasive as human- generated content."
