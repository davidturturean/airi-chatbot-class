Title: International AI Safety Report 2025\nRisk Category: Risks from malicious use\nRisk Subcategory: Manipulation of public opinion\nAdditional Evidence: "General-purpose AI can generate potentially persuasive content at unprecedented scale and with a high degree of sophistication. Previously, generating content to manipulate public opinion often involved a strong trade- off between quality and quantity.

Some studies have also found them to be as persuasive as human- generated content."
