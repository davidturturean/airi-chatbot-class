Title: Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile\nRisk Category: CBRN Information or Capabilities\nAdditional Evidence: "Recent research on this topic found that LLM outputs regarding biological threat creation and attack planning provided minimal assistance beyond traditional search engine queries, suggesting that state-of- the-art LLMs at the time these studies were conducted do not substantially increase the operational likelihood of such an attack. The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or biological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and infrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key barriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI can help actors address those barriers."
