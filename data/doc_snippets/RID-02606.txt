Title: The Risks of Machine Learning Systems\nRisk Category: First-Order Risks\nRisk Subcategory: Application\nAdditional Evidence: "Stakeholders’ machine learning literacy: To give useful feedback and seek remediation, the affected community member might require basic knowledge of how ML systems work and the ways they could be impacted. For example, someone unaware of how recommendation algorithms work (or even the existence of such algorithms) may be unable to appreciate the extent to which their political views are influenced by their consumption of social media and video streaming sites [10, 15, 79, 151].2 The affected individual will hence be unaware that they are in an echo chamber, resulting in an inability to break free or give appropriate feedback to the product developers [96]. Research has also shown a person’s knowledge of AI to affect their interpretation of machine-generated explanations [59]."
