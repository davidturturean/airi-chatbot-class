Title: A Survey of Artificial Intelligence Challenges: Analyzing the Definitions, Relationships, and Evolutions\nDomain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\nSub-domain: 7.3 > Lack of capability or robustness\nRisk Category: Robustness and Reliability\nDescription: The robustness of an AI-based model refers to the stability of the model performance after abnormal changes in the input data... The cause of this change may be a malicious attacker, environmental noise, or a crash of other components of an AI-based system... This problem may be challenging in HLI-based agents because weak robustness may have appeared in unreliable machine learning models, and hence an HLI with this drawback is error-prone in practice.\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
