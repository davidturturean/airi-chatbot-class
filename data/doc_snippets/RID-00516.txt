Title: Towards risk-aware artificial intelligence and machine learning systems: An overview\nRisk Subcategory: Adversarial attack\nAdditional Evidence: "In general, adversarial attacks can be grouped into two classes: 1. Targeted adversarial attack: The goal of targeted adversarial attack is to make an AI/ML model classify an adversarial image with a true label of K as a target class T (T âˆ•= K ) through intentional design (i.e., data manipulation). 2. Untargeted adversarial attack: The objective of untargeted adversarial attack is to make an AI/ML model generate a prediction that is different from the true label without intended target"
