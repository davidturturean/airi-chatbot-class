Title: AI_Risk_Repository_Preprint

Content:
When we included new documents in the AI Risk Repository, we emailed the authors of those documents to identify additional relevant documents

On the AI Risk Repository website, we provided a public form for proposal of relevant documents

In personal communications, presentations, and other interactions with experts (e.g., when invited to a roundtable on AI risks), we informally asked attendees if they were aware of additional relevant documents.

Approximately every 3 months, we screened the proposed documents. For included documents, we extracted and coded the risks as described above.
