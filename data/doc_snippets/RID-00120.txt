Title: Mapping the Ethics of Generative AI: A Comprehensive Scoping Review\nDomain: 5. Human-Computer Interaction\nSub-domain: 5.1 > Overreliance and unsafe use\nRisk Category: Interaction risks\nDescription: Many novel risks posed by generative AI stem from the ways in which humans interact with these systems. For instance, sources discuss epistemic challenges in distinguishing AI-generated from human content. They also address the issue of anthropomorphization, which can lead to an excessive trust in generative AI systems. On a similar note, many papers argue that the use of conversational agents could impact mental well-being or gradually supplant interpersonal communication, potentially leading to a dehumanization of interactions. Additionally, a frequently discussed interaction risk in the literature is the potential of LLMs to manipulate human behavior or to instigate users to engage in unethical or illegal activities.\nEntity: 3 - Other\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
