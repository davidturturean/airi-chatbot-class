Title: Generative AI and ChatGPT: Applications, Challenges, and AI-Human Collaboration\nDomain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations\nSub-domain: 7.3 > Lack of capability or robustness\nRisk Category: Technology concerns\nRisk Subcategory: Quality of training data\nDescription: "The quality of training data is another challenge faced by generative AI. The quality of generative AI models largely depends on the quality of the training data (Dwivedi et al., 2023; Su & Yang, 2023). Any factual errors, unbalanced information sources, or biases embedded in the training data may be reflected in the output of the model. Generative AI models, such as ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion which is a text-to-image model, often require large amounts of training data (Gozalo-Brizuela & Garrido-Merchan, 2023). It is important to not only have high-quality training datasets but also have complete and balanced datasets."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 2 - Unintentional\nTiming: 1 - Pre-deployment
