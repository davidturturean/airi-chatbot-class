AI Risk Domain: 4.2 > Cyberattacks, weapon development or use, and mass harm\n\nThis domain contains 69 risk entries from the AI Risk Repository:\n\nRisk Entry 1:\nTitle: TASRA: a Taxonomy and Analysis of Societal-Scale Risks from AI\nDomain: 4. Malicious Actors & Misuse\nSub-domain: 4.2 > Cyberattacks, weapon development or use, and mass harm\nRisk Category: Type 5: Criminal weaponization\nDescription: One or more criminal entities could create AI to intentionally inflict harms, such as for terrorism or combating law enforcement.\nAdditional Evidence: "Itâ€™s not difficult to envision AI technology causing harm if it falls into the hands of people looking to cause trouble, so no stories will be provided in this section. It is enough to imagine an algorithm designed to pilot delivery drones that could be re-purposed to carry explosive charges, or an algorithm designed to deliver therapy that could have its goal altered to deliver psychological trauma.
