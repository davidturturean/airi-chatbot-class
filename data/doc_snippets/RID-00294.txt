Title: The Risks of Machine Learning Systems\nRisk Category: First-Order Risks\nRisk Subcategory: Training & validation data\nAdditional Evidence: "Presence of personal information: The presence of personal information in the training data increases the risk of the ML model memorizing this information, as deep neural networks have been shown to do. This could lead to downstream consequences for privacy when membership inference attacks are used to extract such information. We discuss this in greater detail in Section 5.4."
