Taxonomy categories with a prevalence ≥ 10% are highlighted. Categories with a prevalence less than 2% in the AI Risk Database are shown as • for ease of interpretation. Causal factors of AI risk examined by included documents Papers varied significantly in terms of which causal factors they examined (see Table 5). Two documents have blank rows in the table because they did not present risks that could be coded against the Causal Taxonomy (#26, AI Verify Foundation, 2023; #36, Sharma, 2024). Human-related risks were identified in 55 out of 65 documents (83%), AI-related risks in 61 out of 65 documents (92%), and other risks in 48 out of 65 documents (72%). Regarding intent, intentional risks were noted in 55 out of 65 documents (85%), unintentional risks in 54 out of 65 documents (82%), and other intent-related risks in 57 out of 65 documents (86%). In terms of timing, pre-deployment risks were identified in 39 out of 65 documents (58%), post-deployment risks in 59 out of 65 documents (89%), and other timing-related risks in 53 out of 65 documents (82%). The majority of documents recognized risks arising from both human and AI actions, with near equal acknowledgment of intentional and unintentional risks. Post-deployment risks were more frequently discussed than pre-deployment risks, indicating the documents included focused more on the consequences of deployed AI systems. Table 5.
