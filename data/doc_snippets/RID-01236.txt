Title: Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile\nRisk Category: Value Chain and Component Integration\nAdditional Evidence: "Errors in third-party GAI components can also have downstream impacts on accuracy and robustness. For example, test datasets commonly used to benchmark or validate models can contain label errors. Inaccuracies in these labels can impact the “stability” or robustness of these benchmarks, which many GAI practitioners consider during the model selection process."
