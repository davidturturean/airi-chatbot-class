Title: Generative AI and ChatGPT: Applications, Challenges, and AI-Human Collaboration\nDomain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity\nSub-domain: 1.2 > Exposure to toxic content\nRisk Category: Ethical Concerns\nRisk Subcategory: Harmful or inappropriate content\nDescription: "Harmful or inappropriate content produced by generative AI includes but is not limited to violent content, the use of offensive language, discriminative content, and pornography. Although OpenAI has set up a content policy for ChatGPT, harmful or inappropriate content can still appear due to reasons such as algorithmic limitations or jailbreaking (i.e., removal of restrictions imposed). The language modelsâ€™ ability to understand or generate harmful or offensive content is referred to as toxicity (Zhuo et al., 2023). Toxicity can bring harm to society and damage the harmony of the community. Hence, it is crucial to ensure that harmful or offensive information is not present in the training data and is removed if they are. Similarly, the training data should be free of pornographic, sexual, or erotic content (Zhuo et al., 2023). Regulations, policies, and governance should be in place to ensure any undesirable content is not displayed to users."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
