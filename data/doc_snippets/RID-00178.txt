Title: Managing the ethical and risk implications of rapid advances in artificial intelligence: A literature review\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.5 > Governance failure\nRisk Category: AI jurisprudence\nRisk Subcategory: AI jurisprudence\nDescription: "When considering legal frameworks, we note that at present no such framework has been identified in literature which would apply blame and responsibility to an autonomous agent for its actions. (Though we do suggest that the recent establishment of laws regarding autonomous vehicles may provide some early frameworks that can be evaluated for efficacy and gaps in future research.) Frequently the literature refers to existing liability and negligence laws which might apply to the manufacturer or operator of a device."\nEntity: 1 - Human\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
