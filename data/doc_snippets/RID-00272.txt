Title: The Risks of Machine Learning Systems\nRisk Category: First-Order Risks\nRisk Subcategory: Application\nAdditional Evidence: "Consequentiality of system actions: The impact of the ML system’s actions on the affected community members is another important factor in the system’s application. For example, a slightly inaccurate automated text scoring system carries relatively minor consequences if used only for providing feedback on ungraded homework, compared to being used for grading school assignments. While inaccuracies in the latter use case may affect a student’s annual ranking, it carries a lower risk compared to using the same system to grade national exams that determine a student’s future, where even minor inaccuracies can unfairly impact their ability to enter their desired university or major [65]."
