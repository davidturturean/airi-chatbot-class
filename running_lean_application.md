# Running Lean Methodology Applied to AI Risk Repository Chatbot

## Overview
This document maps the Running Lean methodology to our AI Risk Repository Chatbot deployment, addressing Peter's request for how we apply these principles to our gradual release strategy.

## Running Lean Core Concepts

### 1. Three Stages of Product Development

#### Stage 1: Problem/Solution Fit
**Goal:** Validate that the problem is worth solving and our solution approach is viable.

**Our Implementation (Gates 1-3):**
- **Gate 1: Intent Classification Accuracy (>90%)**
  - Validates that we correctly understand what users are asking
  - Problem: Users need accurate AI risk information
  - Solution: AI-powered search through repository
  
- **Gate 2: Citation Accuracy (100%)**
  - Validates our solution provides trustworthy information
  - Problem: Misinformation about AI risks
  - Solution: Only cite verified repository documents

- **Gate 3: Response Time (P50 <3s)**
  - Validates solution is practically usable
  - Problem: Manual search is time-consuming
  - Solution: Fast automated retrieval

**Status:** ✅ Achieved - Ready for internal testing

#### Stage 2: Product/Market Fit
**Goal:** Build something people want and will actually use.

**Our Implementation (Gates 4-7):**
- **Gate 4: User Satisfaction (>4/5)**
  - Direct measure of product/market fit
  - Collected via post-interaction surveys
  
- **Gate 5: Return User Rate (>30%)**
  - Validates ongoing value delivery
  - Users come back = product fits need
  
- **Gate 6: Query Success Rate (>80%)**
  - Measures how well we serve user needs
  - High success = good market fit
  
- **Gate 7: Engagement Rate (>50%)**
  - Users engage with citations/features
  - Shows depth of product value

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress - Requires user testing data

#### Stage 3: Scale
**Goal:** Accelerate growth and optimize distribution.

**Our Implementation (Gates 8-10):**
- **Gate 8: System Uptime (>99.5%)**
  - Ready for production scale
  - Reliability for larger user base
  
- **Gate 9: Concurrent Users (>100)**
  - Can handle growth
  - Infrastructure scales with demand
  
- **Gate 10: Cost per Query (<$0.10)**
  - Economically sustainable at scale
  - Efficient resource utilization

**Status:** ⏳ Future - After achieving product/market fit

## Running Lean Principles Applied

### 1. "Get Out of the Building"
**Principle:** Talk to customers, don't assume.

**Our Application:**
- 6-10 user testing sessions planned
- Direct observation of user interactions
- Post-session interviews
- Recording analysis for behavior patterns

### 2. "Measure What Matters"
**Principle:** Focus on actionable metrics, not vanity metrics.

**Our Metrics:**
| Vanity Metric ❌ | Actionable Metric ✅ | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Total queries | Query success rate | Shows if we're solving problems |
| Page views | Return user rate | Indicates real value delivery |
| Time on site | Task completion rate | Measures effectiveness |
| Total users | User satisfaction score | Direct feedback on fit |

### 3. "Build-Measure-Learn"
**Principle:** Rapid iteration based on feedback.

**Our Cycle:**
```
Build → Internal Testing (Stage 1)
  ↓
Measure → 6-10 user sessions
  ↓
Learn → Analyze feedback
  ↓
Build → Implement improvements
  ↓
Measure → Canary deployment (Stage 2)
  ↓
Learn → Monitor metrics
  ↓
Build → Full release (Stage 3)
```

### 4. "Pivot or Persevere"
**Principle:** Be ready to change direction based on data.

**Our Decision Points:**

**After Internal Testing:**
- **Persevere** if: >50% would recommend
- **Pivot** if: <50% would recommend
- **Kill** if: <30% would recommend

**After Canary:**
- **Persevere** if: 6/10 gates pass
- **Pivot** if: 4-5/10 gates pass
- **Kill** if: <4/10 gates pass

**After Production:**
- **Scale** if: 8/10 gates pass
- **Optimize** if: 6-7/10 gates pass
- **Revisit** if: <6/10 gates pass

## Deployment Stages Mapped to Running Lean

### Stage 1: Internal Testing (Problem/Solution Fit)
- **Users:** 6-10 testers
- **Focus:** Does this solve a real problem?
- **Key Question:** "Would you be disappointed if this didn't exist?"
- **Success Criteria:** >50% say yes

### Stage 2: Canary Deployment (Product/Market Fit)
- **Users:** 50-100 beta users
- **Focus:** Do people want to use this regularly?
- **Key Question:** "How likely are you to recommend this?"
- **Success Criteria:** NPS >30

### Stage 3: Production Release (Scale)
- **Users:** All MIT community
- **Focus:** Can we grow sustainably?
- **Key Question:** "How can we reach more users?"
- **Success Criteria:** Growth rate >10% monthly

## Feedback Thresholds (Answering Peter's Question)

Based on Running Lean principles:

| Stage | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Password Protected | >50% would recommend | Open to canary |
| Canary (50 users) | >70% satisfaction | Open to production |
| Production | >80% satisfaction | Maintain & scale |

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

Following Running Lean's "de-risk systematically" approach:

1. **Product Risk** (Can we build it?) ✅ Already built
2. **Customer Risk** (Do they want it?) 🔄 Testing now
3. **Market Risk** (Is it viable?) ⏳ Will know after canary

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1:** Problem/Solution Fit
- Run 6-10 user tests
- Measure gates 1-3
- Decision: Proceed to Stage 2?

**Week 2-3:** Product/Market Fit
- Deploy to 50 beta users
- Measure gates 4-7
- Decision: Ready for production?

**Week 4+:** Scale
- Full production release
- Measure gates 8-10
- Continuous optimization

## Key Takeaways for Peter

1. **We're following Running Lean's staged approach** - Not jumping straight to scale
2. **Clear thresholds at each stage** - 50% → 70% → 80% satisfaction
3. **Focus on learning, not launching** - Each stage teaches us something
4. **Ready to pivot based on data** - Not emotionally attached to current solution
5. **Measuring what matters** - User satisfaction, not vanity metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Internal Testing** - Get our first Problem/Solution Fit data
2. **Apply Learning** - Iterate based on feedback
3. **Graduate to Canary** - When >50% would recommend
4. **Scale Gradually** - Only after proving Product/Market Fit

*"Life's too short to build something nobody wants."* - Ash Maurya, Running Lean

This approach ensures we build something users actually need, not what we think they need.
