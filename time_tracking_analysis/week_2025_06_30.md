### Commits Found (2025-06-27 to 2025-07-04)
No commits found in this date range.

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Logged vs Actual Work

**Logged Tasks:**
1. "Simplified UI/UX and local setup" - No commit evidence
2. "Chat feature implementation" - No commit evidence  
3. "MongoDB connection" - No commit evidence
4. "Sidebar feature" - No commit evidence

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Work was done locally but committed in the July 7 massive refactor
2. This could be initial development that was later completely rewritten
3. The MongoDB work may have been exploratory/testing

## Time Estimation

Given the massive commit on July 11 (307 files) and the described work:
- The features described here likely formed the foundation for that refactor
- Chat feature and sidebar are core components that appear in later commits
- MongoDB connection work may have been replaced with the hybrid retrieval system

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 8 hours
- **GitHub Evidence**: 0 commits
- **Assessment**: Work likely incorporated into July 11 refactor

## Evidence Summary
No direct commit evidence, but the described features (chat, sidebar, database connection) are all present in the July 11 massive commit. This suggests the work was done but held locally or was prototype work that got completely refactored.

## Conclusion
Cannot determine underlogging from commits alone. The 8 hours logged seems reasonable for initial prototype work that would later be refactored into the production system.
