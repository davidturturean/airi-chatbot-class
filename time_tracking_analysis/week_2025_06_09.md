2. Citation system implementation
3. Migration guide creation (208 lines)
4. Massive codebase cleanup (6.2M lines deleted!)
5. Documentation overhaul

## Time Estimation

### Actual Coding Time Based on Complexity:
- **Architecture refactor**: ~8-10 hours
- **Citation system**: ~3-4 hours
- **Codebase cleanup**: ~2-3 hours
- **Migration documentation**: ~2 hours
- **Testing and validation**: ~3-4 hours

**Estimated Actual Coding Hours**: 18-25 hours

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 5 hours
- **Estimated Actual**: 18-25 hours
- **Underlogged by**: 13-20 hours (260-400% underreporting)

## Evidence Summary
This commit represents a fundamental architectural change to the entire system. The scale (26,691 files changed) and the description "Complete modular architecture refactor" indicate multiple days of work. The deletion of 6.2 million lines suggests removing dependencies/backups and completely restructuring the project.

## Conclusion
Severe underlogging detected. The actual work represents approximately 3.6-5x the logged hours. This appears to be initial project setup and architecture establishment, which is always time-intensive.
