## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Logged vs Actual Work

**Logged Tasks:**
1. âœ… "Excel file processing" - PARTIALLY CONFIRMED
   - Evidence: Removal of Excel temp file in commits
   - Doc snippet updates suggest data processing

**Unlogged Major Work:**
1. Complete deployment infrastructure setup
2. Docker containerization
3. Railway deployment configuration
4. Netlify configuration
5. Deployment documentation (104+ lines)
6. Deploy automation script
7. Frontend API patching enhancements
8. Environment variable management

## Time Estimation

### Actual Coding Time Based on Complexity:
- **Deployment infrastructure**: ~3-4 hours
- **Docker setup and testing**: ~2-3 hours
- **Documentation writing**: ~1-2 hours
- **Deploy script and automation**: ~1-2 hours
- **Excel data processing**: ~2-3 hours
- **Frontend API updates**: ~1-2 hours
- **Testing and debugging**: ~2-3 hours

**Estimated Actual Coding Hours**: 12-18 hours

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 6 hours
- **Estimated Actual**: 12-18 hours
- **Underlogged by**: 6-12 hours (100-200% underreporting)

## Evidence Summary
The commits show significant deployment infrastructure work that wasn't mentioned in the time tracking. Setting up Docker, Railway, Netlify, and creating comprehensive deployment documentation represents substantial effort beyond the logged Excel processing task.

## Conclusion
Moderate to severe underlogging. The actual work represents approximately 2-3x the logged hours. The deployment infrastructure alone would take most of the logged 6 hours, not including the Excel processing work that was actually logged.
