## Time Estimation

### Actual Coding Time Based on Complexity:
- **Query processor overhaul**: ~4-5 hours
- **Test suite creation (105 prompts)**: ~3-4 hours
- **Response formatter**: ~2-3 hours
- **Gemini pool implementation**: ~2-3 hours
- **Smart web search**: ~2-3 hours
- **Response validator**: ~2 hours
- **70+ snippet updates**: ~3-4 hours
- **Integration tests**: ~2 hours
- **Testing and debugging**: ~4-5 hours

**Estimated Actual Coding Hours**: 24-31 hours

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 16 hours
- **Estimated Actual**: 24-31 hours
- **Underlogged by**: 8-15 hours (50-94% underreporting)

## Evidence Summary
This week shows significant underlogging. The commits demonstrate massive architectural improvements and comprehensive testing infrastructure that would require substantially more time than logged. The 105 prompts test alone, with its 2779-line result file, represents extensive testing work. The query processor overhaul (315+ lines) is a major refactoring effort.

## Conclusion
Moderate to severe underlogging. The actual work represents approximately 1.5-2x the logged hours. This week had the most accurate logging so far, but still significantly underreports the actual development effort, especially considering the scope of architectural changes and comprehensive testing performed.
