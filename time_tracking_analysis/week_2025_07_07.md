## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Logged vs Actual Work

**Logged Tasks:**
1. ✅ "Deployed v1 of chatbot" - CONFIRMED
   - Evidence: Multiple Railway deployment fixes
   - Dockerfile modifications for production
   
2. ✅ "Local hosting for Sasha" - PARTIALLY CONFIRMED
   - Evidence: Environment configuration updates
   - Testing brief creation (CHATBOT_TESTING_BRIEF.md)

**Unlogged Major Work:**
1. Massive codebase refactoring (307 files!)
2. Field-Aware Hybrid Retrieval implementation
3. 80+ snippet files creation
4. Complete backend restructuring
5. Testing framework development
6. Legacy code removal and cleanup
7. Production deployment debugging (4 commits)
8. Intent classifier fixes

## Time Estimation

### Actual Coding Time Based on Complexity:
- **Codebase refactoring (307 files)**: ~15-20 hours
- **Field-Aware Hybrid Retrieval**: ~4-6 hours
- **80+ snippet files**: ~4-5 hours
- **Testing framework**: ~2-3 hours
- **Deployment configuration**: ~2-3 hours
- **Production debugging**: ~2-3 hours
- **Documentation and cleanup**: ~2-3 hours

**Estimated Actual Coding Hours**: 31-42 hours

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 3 hours
- **Estimated Actual**: 31-42 hours
- **Underlogged by**: 28-39 hours (933-1300% underreporting)

## Evidence Summary
This week shows the most severe underlogging so far. The 307-file change with 13,416 insertions represents one of the largest refactoring efforts in the project. This is clearly multiple days of full-time work, not 3 hours. The deployment work alone (which was logged) would take more than 3 hours given the multiple debugging commits.

## Conclusion
Extreme underlogging detected. The actual work represents approximately 10-14x the logged hours. This appears to be a major milestone week with comprehensive system overhaul that was severely underreported.
