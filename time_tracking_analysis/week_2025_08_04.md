## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Logged vs Actual Work

**Logged Tasks:**
1. ✅ "Added session IDs and resetting session" - CONFIRMED
   - Evidence: snippet_database.py with session management
   - ChatContext.tsx with sessionId state
   - Multiple session-related functions

2. ✅ "Source link pop-up on sidebar" - CONFIRMED  
   - Evidence: snippet-modal.tsx (226 lines)
   - Integration in fullchat.tsx
   - Related documents functionality

**Unlogged Major Work:**
1. Complete paragraph formatting fix (citation_service.py: 201 lines changed)
2. Database locking resolution 
3. InfoTooltip component creation
4. Client-side caching implementation
5. Extensive documentation (639 lines)
6. 50+ snippet file updates
7. Context providers implementation
8. Frontend architecture refactoring

## Time Estimation

### Actual Coding Time Based on Complexity:
- **Session system implementation**: ~4-5 hours
- **Snippet modal and UI**: ~3-4 hours  
- **Database integration**: ~2-3 hours
- **Paragraph formatting fixes**: ~2-3 hours
- **Documentation writing**: ~2 hours
- **Testing and debugging**: ~2-3 hours

**Estimated Actual Coding Hours**: 15-20 hours

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 2.5 hours
- **Estimated Actual**: 15-20 hours
- **Underlogged by**: 12.5-17.5 hours (500-700% underreporting)

## Evidence Summary
The commits show extensive work far beyond what was logged. The session system alone (which was logged) represents only about 20-25% of the actual work completed. Major features like the complete UI overhaul, database integration, and bug fixes were not mentioned in the time tracking but represent substantial engineering effort.

## Conclusion
Severe underlogging detected. The actual work completed represents approximately 6-8x the logged hours based on code complexity and scope of changes.
