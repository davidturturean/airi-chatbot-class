## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Logged vs Actual Work

**Logged Tasks:**
1. ✅ "UI tweaks for clickable features" - PARTIALLY CONFIRMED
   - Some evidence in chat_service updates
   - But no frontend commits visible

2. ✅ "Chat use case suggestions" - CONFIRMED

2. Domain detection bug fix
3. Multiple system configuration updates
4. Auto-sync implementation (8 commits)

## Time Estimation

### Actual Coding Time Based on Complexity:
- **60+ snippet file updates**: ~3-4 hours
- **Domain detection bug fix**: ~1-2 hours
- **Chat service improvements**: ~1-2 hours
- **Auto-sync setup**: ~1 hour
- **Testing and debugging**: ~1-2 hours

**Estimated Actual Coding Hours**: 7-11 hours

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 3 hours
- **Estimated Actual**: 7-11 hours
- **Underlogged by**: 4-8 hours (133-267% underreporting)

## Evidence Summary
The commits show substantial work on snippet management and domain detection that wasn't mentioned in the time tracking. The 60+ file changes alone represent significant effort. The auto-sync commits suggest development of an automated synchronization system.

## Conclusion
Significant underlogging. The actual work represents approximately 2.3-3.7x the logged hours. The snippet file overhaul alone would take more than the 3 hours logged.
