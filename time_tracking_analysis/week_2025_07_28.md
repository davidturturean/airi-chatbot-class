## GitHub Analysis

### Commits Found (2025-07-25 to 2025-08-01)
No commits found in this date range.

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Logged vs Actual Work

**Logged Tasks:**
1. "Snippet brief for Sasha" - No direct commit evidence
2. "RAG Chatbot polishing" - No commit evidence
3. "Regex-like prompt detection" - No commit evidence
4. "Technical prompt handling" - No commit evidence

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Work was done locally but not committed until later (possibly included in 8/4 commits)
2. Work was exploratory/testing without commits
3. Commits may have been squashed or merged later

## Time Estimation

Given no commits in this period but substantial commits in the following week:
- The work described likely contributed to the massive commits on 8/5
- Testing and brief creation are non-commit activities
- Code development may have been staged locally

### Discrepancy Analysis
- **Logged**: 6 hours
- **GitHub Evidence**: 0 commits
- **Assessment**: Work likely rolled into next week's commits

## Evidence Summary
No direct commit evidence for this week, but the described work aligns with features that appeared in the 8/5 commits (snippet system, improved prompt handling). This suggests development work was ongoing but not committed until the following week.

## Conclusion
Cannot determine underlogging from commits alone. Work appears to have been batched with the following week's massive commits.
