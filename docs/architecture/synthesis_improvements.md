## Results

Now when you run the 105 prompts test:

1. **Healthcare AI bias query** - Synthesizes answer from general bias principles
2. **Cross-domain privacy analysis** - Retrieves documents from both domains
3. **Algorithmic fairness methodologies** - Applies general principles to specific context
4. **Current trends queries** - Triggers web search only when needed
5. **Technical queries** - Handles properly without crashes

The system is now much more helpful while maintaining focus on the AI Risk Repository as the primary source!
