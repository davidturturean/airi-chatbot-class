<h1>AI Risk Repository Chatbot: User Experience Testing Brief</h1>

<div class="section">
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The MIT AI Risk Repository project has developed an interactive chatbot interface to provide users with empirically-grounded, evidence-based information about AI risks. This chatbot serves as a conversational gateway to the comprehensive MIT AI Risk Repository, which contains thousands of documented AI risks, their impacts, and potential mitigations.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Current Chatbot Capabilities:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>Provides accurate, non-hallucinated responses based exclusively on AI Risk Repository data</li>
    <li>Employs advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with field-aware hybrid search</li>
    <li>Includes clickable citations linking directly to source documents</li>
    <li>Covers comprehensive AI risk domains including safety, privacy, bias, governance, and socioeconomic impacts</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bold">Known Limitations:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>Basic interface lacking user guidance and expectation management</li>
    <li>Response times of 5-10 seconds without user feedback during processing</li>
    <li>Limited context provided about the chatbot's purpose, scope, and capabilities</li>
    <li>Minimal formatting and visual hierarchy in response presentation</li>
    <li>Unclear link styling and interaction patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>The chatbot represents a critical component of the AI Risk Repository's mission to make AI risk research accessible to policymakers, researchers, and practitioners. As we prepare for broader deployment, we need systematic user feedback to optimize the interface and user experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Testing Objectives</h2>

<p>For this testing phase, we aim to:</p>

<ol>
    <li><span class="bold">Evaluate User Experience</span>: Assess the clarity, usability, and intuitiveness of the current chatbot interface</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Identify Friction Points</span>: Document specific moments where users experience confusion, frustration, or uncertainty</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Validate Information Architecture</span>: Determine whether users understand the chatbot's purpose, scope, and capabilities</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Optimize Response Presentation</span>: Gather feedback on formatting, citation display, and content organization</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Assess User Expectations</span>: Understand what users expect from an AI risk chatbot and how our implementation aligns with those expectations</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Prioritize Improvements</span>: Identify the most impactful modifications for enhancing user satisfaction and task completion</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Testing Protocol</h2>

<h3>Testing Session Structure</h3>

<p><span class="bold">Phase 1: Initial Impressions (3-5 minutes)</span></p>
<ol>
    <li>Arrive at the chatbot interface without prior instruction</li>
    <li>Spend 2-3 minutes exploring the interface before sending any messages</li>

<h2>Technical Considerations</h2>

<p><span class="bold">Data Collection Transparency</span>: Please note that the backend system logs all user inputs for analysis and improvement purposes. Your interactions will be used to enhance the chatbot's functionality and user experience. Personal information should not be included in your test queries.</p>

<p><span class="bold">System Architecture</span>: The chatbot employs advanced retrieval techniques including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Field-aware hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword matching</li>
    <li>Multi-model fallback for enhanced reliability</li>
    <li>Semantic intent classification to optimize response relevance</li>
    <li>Real-time citation consistency validation</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bold">Performance Context</span>: Current response times of 5-10 seconds reflect the system's comprehensive search and validation processes. We are exploring options for progress indicators and interim feedback during processing.</p>
