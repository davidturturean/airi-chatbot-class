# Executive Summary: AI Risk Repository Chatbot Deployment Strategy

**Date:** September 11, 2024  
**To:** Peter Slattery  
**From:** David Turturean  
**Re:** Chatbot Deployment Readiness & Staged Release Plan

## Current State

The AI Risk Repository Chatbot technical infrastructure is **complete and ready for Stage 1: Internal Testing**.

### Completed Components
✅ Chatbot fully integrated into airisk.mit.edu via Webflow  
✅ Real-time metrics dashboard with 10 deployment gates (zero mock data)  
✅ PostHog analytics integration ready (API key configured)  
✅ Performance monitoring and cost tracking systems operational  
✅ Citation system validated and "preprint raw.txt" issue resolved  

### Ready to Deploy
- Password protection can be enabled on Webflow immediately
- Testing materials prepared for 6-10 internal users
- Dashboard ready to collect and display real metrics
- All monitoring systems operational

## Proposed Three-Stage Deployment

### Stage 1: Internal Testing (Week 1)
- **Access:** Password-protected Webflow page
- **Users:** 6-10 FutureTech team & stakeholders  
- **Success Criteria:** 6/10 gates passing, 70% satisfaction
- **Key Activities:** Structured testing sessions, bug fixes, UI refinement

### Stage 2: Canary Release (Weeks 2-3)
- **Access:** 5-10% traffic split via A/B testing
- **Users:** Selected researchers and early adopters
- **Success Criteria:** 8/10 gates passing, 60% containment rate
- **Key Activities:** Performance optimization, ROI demonstration

### Stage 3: Full Production (Week 4+)
- **Access:** Public release to all visitors
- **Users:** All airisk.mit.edu users
- **Success Criteria:** 8-10/10 gates passing, 30% ticket deflection
- **Key Activities:** Scaling, continuous improvement

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

**Clear thresholds answering "What level is good enough?"**

| Stage Transition | Minimum Requirements |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Testing → Canary** | 6/10 gates, 70% satisfaction, 0 critical bugs |
| **Canary → Production** | 8/10 gates, 80% satisfaction, 20% ticket deflection |

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Gradual rollout minimizes exposure
   - Kill switch ready (disable generation, fall back to search)
   - Real-time monitoring alerts for threshold violations

2. **User Experience Risks**
   - Password protection for initial testing
   - Feedback incorporated before wider release
   - Clear communication about beta status

3. **Cost Risks**
   - Per-query cost tracking from day one
   - Budget alerts at $0.30/query threshold
   - Automatic throttling if costs spike

## Required Actions (This Week)

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Enable password protection on Webflow page
2. ✅ Share access credentials with test users
3. ✅ Schedule 6 testing sessions for next week

### Before Testing Starts
1. Confirm PostHog tracking is active
2. Brief testers on objectives and process
3. Ensure support availability during sessions

### During Testing Week
1. Monitor dashboard daily
2. Address critical bugs immediately
3. Compile feedback for go/no-go decision

## Resource Requirements

- **Time:** 2-3 hours/day during testing week for monitoring and fixes
- **Budget:** ~$50-100 for API costs during testing phase
- **People:** You (oversight), David (technical), Sasha (UI/UX)

## Success Metrics

**By end of Week 1, we will know:**
- Actual user satisfaction scores
- Real-world performance metrics
- Critical bugs and blockers
- Whether to proceed to canary release

**By end of Week 3, we will know:**
- ROI potential (ticket deflection rate)
- Scalability at production load
- Total cost of ownership
- Whether to proceed to full production

## Recommendation

**Proceed immediately with Stage 1: Internal Testing**

The system is technically ready, monitoring is in place, and we have clear success criteria. The staged approach minimizes risk while providing data-driven decision points. The password-protected testing phase will provide valuable feedback before any public exposure.

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review deployment stages and gates (5 min)
2. Confirm testing participants and schedule (5 min)
3. Approve password protection implementation (2 min)
4. Discuss success criteria adjustments if needed (5 min)
5. Set Week 1 check-in schedule (3 min)
