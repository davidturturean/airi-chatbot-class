# AI Risk Repository Chatbot - Go/No-Go Decision Matrix

## Purpose
This document answers Peter's key question: **"What level/scale of recommendation is good enough to move forward?"**

## Decision Framework

### Stage Progression Criteria

Each stage transition requires meeting specific thresholds across multiple dimensions. A **GO** decision requires meeting ALL mandatory criteria and MOST recommended criteria.

---

## Stage 1 → Stage 2: Internal Testing → Canary Release

### Mandatory Criteria (ALL must be met for GO)

| Criterion | Threshold | Measurement | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Deployment Gates** | ≥ 6/10 passing | Automated dashboard | Ensures basic quality standards |
| **User Satisfaction** | ≥ 70% positive | Post-session survey | Validates user acceptance |
| **Critical Bugs** | 0 unresolved | Bug tracker | Prevents major failures |
| **Response Time** | Median < 5 seconds | Performance metrics | Ensures usable experience |
| **Safety Violations** | 0 incidents | Manual review | Protects users and reputation |

### Recommended Criteria (≥3/5 should be met)

| Criterion | Threshold | Measurement | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Task Completion** | ≥ 60% success | Testing sessions | Shows functional value |
| **Citation Accuracy** | ≥ 90% valid | Spot checks | Maintains trust |
| **Feature Requests** | Documented & prioritized | Feedback analysis | Guides improvements |
| **Cost Projection** | < $0.50/query | Usage analysis | Ensures sustainability |
| **Team Consensus** | Unanimous agreement | Team meeting | Aligns stakeholders |

### NO-GO Triggers
- Any critical security vulnerability
- Consistent timeout issues (>20% of queries)
- Legal/compliance concerns raised
- Major UI/UX blocker identified
- Team member strong objection with valid concern

## Stage 2 → Stage 3: Canary Release → Full Production

### Mandatory Criteria (ALL must be met for GO)

| Criterion | Threshold | Measurement | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Deployment Gates** | ≥ 8/10 passing | Automated dashboard | High quality bar for production |
| **User Satisfaction** | ≥ 80% positive | In-app feedback | Strong user approval |
| **Containment Rate** | ≥ 60% | Support ticket analysis | Reduces support burden |
| **Cost per Query** | < $0.30 | Actual usage data | Economically viable |
| **Uptime** | ≥ 99% during canary | Monitoring tools | Reliability proven |
| **Error Rate** | < 5% | Error logs | Acceptable failure rate |

### Recommended Criteria (≥4/6 should be met)

| Criterion | Threshold | Measurement | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Ticket Deflection** | ≥ 20% reduction | Support metrics | Demonstrates ROI |
| **Repeat Usage** | ≥ 30% return rate | Analytics | Shows sustained value |
| **Response Quality** | ≥ 85% accurate | Sampling audit | Maintains credibility |
| **Scale Testing** | 3x load handled | Stress testing | Ready for traffic |
| **Rollback Plan** | Tested successfully | Drill exercise | Risk mitigation |
| **Documentation** | Complete & reviewed | Checklist | Supports users |

### NO-GO Triggers
- Groundedness score < 90%
- Cost exceeds budget by >50%
- Performance degradation under load
- Negative PR or user backlash
- Unresolved data privacy concerns

## Decision Process

### 1. Data Collection (Day Before Decision)
- Generate metrics report from dashboard
- Compile user feedback summary
- Review bug/issue tracker
- Calculate costs and projections
- Document team concerns

### 2. Decision Meeting Agenda
1. **Metrics Review** (10 min)
   - Dashboard walkthrough
   - Gate status summary
   
2. **User Feedback** (10 min)
   - Satisfaction scores
   - Common themes
   - Critical issues
   
3. **Risk Assessment** (10 min)
   - Technical risks
   - Reputational risks
   - Mitigation strategies
   
4. **Go/No-Go Vote** (5 min)
   - Each stakeholder states position
   - Document concerns
   - Reach consensus

5. **Next Steps** (5 min)
   - If GO: Implementation timeline
   - If NO-GO: Remediation plan

### 3. Decision Documentation

## Special Considerations

### Fast-Track Scenarios
Can skip to Stage 3 if ALL of these are true:
- 10/10 gates passing in Stage 1
- >90% user satisfaction
- Zero critical issues
- Strong stakeholder enthusiasm
- Budget allows for risk

### Emergency Rollback
Immediately revert to previous stage if:
- Safety violation occurs
- Cost spike >3x projection
- Major security breach
- System downtime >2 hours
- Legal cease & desist

### Partial Rollout Options
Instead of binary GO/NO-GO:
- **Extend timeline**: More testing time
- **Reduce scope**: Fewer features initially
- **Limit audience**: Specific user segments
- **Add restrictions**: Rate limiting, disclaimers
- **Hybrid approach**: Keep both old and new
