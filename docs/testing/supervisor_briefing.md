## 🔍 What PostHog Tracking Means

**Simple Explanation**: It's like security cameras for your website - shows what people actually do, not what they say they do.

**What We Track**:
- Every question asked
- How long responses take
- Which citations get clicked
- Where people get stuck
- When they give up

**Why It Matters**:
- Real data for go/no-go decisions
- Identifies actual problems
- Proves system performance
- No more guessing
