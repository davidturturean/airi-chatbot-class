## Transformer Architecture: A Technical Explanation

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" [1], revolutionized sequence-to-sequence modeling by dispensing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) entirely, relying instead on **self-attention mechanisms**. This allows for parallelization and significantly improved performance, especially on long sequences.

## Attention Mechanism in Neural Networks: A Technical Explanation

The attention mechanism is a powerful technique used in neural networks, particularly in sequence-to-sequence models, that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating the output sequence.  It addresses the limitations of fixed-length context vectors used in traditional encoder-decoder architectures, which can struggle with long sequences.  The core idea is to assign weights to different part... [6102 total chars]

### Backpropagation in Deep Learning: A Technical Explanation

Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is a supervised learning algorithm used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly deep neural networks. It's a specific application of the chain rule of calculus to efficiently compute the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the network. This gradient is then used to update the weights and biases via optimization algorithms l... [7023 total chars]
