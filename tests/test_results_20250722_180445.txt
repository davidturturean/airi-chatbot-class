## Transformer Architecture: A Technical Explanation

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" [1], revolutionized sequence-to-sequence modeling by dispensing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) entirely, relying instead on **self-attention mechanisms**. This allows for parallelization and significantly improved performance, especially on long sequences.

## Attention Mechanism in Neural Networks: A Technical Explanation

The attention mechanism is a powerful technique used in neural networks, particularly in sequence-to-sequence models, that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating the output sequence.  Instead of relying solely on a fixed-length context vector (as in traditional encoder-decoder models), the attention mechanism enables the decoder to selectively attend to different parts of the input sequ...

Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is a supervised learning algorithm used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly deep neural networks (DNNs). It's a specific application of the chain rule of calculus to efficiently compute the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the network. This gradient is then used to update the network's parameters via optimization alg... [7795 total chars]

Vision Transformers (ViT) represent a significant advancement in image recognition by adapting the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing (NLP), to the domain of computer vision.
