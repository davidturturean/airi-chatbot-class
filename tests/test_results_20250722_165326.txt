## Transformer Architecture: A Technical Explanation

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" [1], revolutionized sequence-to-sequence modeling by dispensing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) entirely, relying instead on **self-attention mechanisms**. This allows for parallelization and improved performance, especially on long sequences.

## Attention Mechanism in Neural Networks: A Technical Explanation

The attention mechanism is a powerful technique used in neural networks, particularly in sequence-to-sequence models, that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating the output sequence.  Instead of relying solely on a fixed-length context vector (as in traditional encoder-decoder models), the attention mechanism enables the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different parts of th...

### Backpropagation in Deep Learning: A Technical Explanation

Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is a supervised learning algorithm used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly deep neural networks. It is a specific application of the chain rule of calculus to efficiently compute the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the network. This gradient is then used to update the network's parameters via optimization algorithm... [7193 total chars]

## Vision Transformers (ViT): A Technical Explanation

Vision Transformers (ViT) represent a paradigm shift in computer vision, adapting the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing (NLP), to image recognition tasks.  ViT models treat images as sequences of patches, enabling them to leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture global relationships within the image, a capability that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often struggle with.
