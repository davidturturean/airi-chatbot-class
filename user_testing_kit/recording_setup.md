   - Play back to ensure audio is clear
   
2. **Find a quiet space**
   - Minimize background noise
   - Close other applications that make sounds

3. **Speak clearly**
   - Normal speaking volume
   - Describe what you're thinking
   - Narrate what you're doing

## During Recording

### Best Practices

**DO:**
- Start recording BEFORE navigating to the site
- Think aloud constantly
- Describe what you see
- Explain your expectations
- Voice frustrations or confusion immediately
- Comment on response times
- Read interesting parts aloud

**DON'T:**
- Edit out mistakes or confusion (we need to see these!)
- Stop recording if something goes wrong
- Worry about "looking stupid"
- Mute yourself while waiting

### Example Commentary

**Good:** "I'm looking at the chatbot interface. I expected to see some example questions or guidance about what I can ask, but I just see an empty text box. I'm not sure if I should ask about specific risks or general topics..."

**Not helpful:** *Silent clicking and typing*
